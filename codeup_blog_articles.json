[{"title": "Spotlight on APIDA Voices: Celebrating Heritage and Inspiring Change ft. Arbeena Thapa", "content": "May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup\u2019s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena\u2019s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena\u2019s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? \u201cI celebrate Nepal\u2019s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. \u201c \u201cOther ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they\u2019re my favorite to make and share.\u201d \u201cOn my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I\u2019ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .\u201d What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? \u201cI often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I\u2019ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. \u201d Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? \u201cBeing overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. \u201c How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? \u201cErasure is big. To me, only saying \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 isn\u2019t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying \u2018Happy Holidays,\u2019 but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. \u201c \u201cOften microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term \u2018micro\u2019 minimizes impact.\u201d \u201cSome that I\u2019ve heard are \u2018What kind of Asian are you?\u2019 or \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 This automatically makes me the \u2018other\u2019 and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as \u201cAsian\u201d.\u201d How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? \u201cI want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.\u201d How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? \u201cI like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. \u201c Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? \u201cPrior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.\u201d A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us. Your words were inspiring and the opportunity to understand your perspective more has been valuable. We hope we can become better support for the APIDA community as we learn and grow on our journey of cultivating inclusive growth."}, {"title": "Women in tech: Panelist Spotlight \u2013 Magdalena Rahn", "content": "Codeup is hosting a Women in Tech Panel in honor of Women\u2019s History Month on March 29th, 2023!

As we learn more about ourselves and grow in our lives, we may find that we\u2019ve outgrown our careers. That\u2019s ok. Below you\u2019ll find six key signs that it is time to change your career. Often, if you\u2019ve been with your company for a while, it becomes easy to accept more responsibility. Over time, you may realize your level of responsibility has grown tremendously, but your pay has not. While your pay should not be everything when evaluating your employment, it is important to be fairly compensated for what is expected of you. Often feeling unappreciated can stem from a company overlooking you for a promotion, failure to re-evaluate your compensation, or simply overworking you. Regardless of the reason, feeling undervalued can quickly lead to burnout. If your company is not willing to make the necessary changes to reflect your value, it may be time to look elsewhere. Sometimes the desire for change does not come from the work, it may be coming from you. We may find our interests shift over time, and this is normal. What we once loved, may no longer be something we find passion in. If this is the case, it is alright to consider a career change to find your new passion. At Codeup we believe you should love your Mondays, and if work no longer excites you, and you dread going to work, you may be lacking fulfillment in your career. No one wants to remain stagnant. If progression in your career seems unlikely, you may want to have a conversation with someone on your leadership team to discuss growth potential. If there is no room for advancement in your current company it may be time for a career change. Toxicity in the workplace is highly unacceptable. If your work environment or superiors exhibit toxic behavior you should consider a change before those actions begin to affect your mental health. \u00a0 Career changes can be scary. If you are considering leaving your current career for a new one, take a look at a career in tech. Beyond being lucrative, there are many benefits to coding careers. Codeup is well equipped to handle career transitions. We offer several scholarships and financial aid offerings to help make jumpstarting your career in tech feasible. We also offer a tuition refund guarantee. This guarantee is a refund of your paid tuition if you do not land a job in-field within six months of completing a Codeup program. We have three different programs, and we would love to help you decide which is a good fit for you. We offer 100% free instructor-led workshops.

If you are a tech professional with skills that are in high demand, you are instantly more valuable. This means that your earning potential is significantly higher, as tech is a very lucrative industry. Essentially, learning to code will help get you hired, and set you apart from other candidates. Many people elect to do freelance work with their coding capabilities. This allows for more control over your schedule, with rates set by you, your choice of which projects to work on, and a very healthy work-life balance. Freelancing comes with freedom. People who consider themselves creative individuals are able to tap into their creativity and apply it to their work as coders. Doing work that you can genuinely enjoy provides fulfillment for most. With a career in coding, you will be continuously learning and improving your problem-solving skills.

While some schools may facilitate job fairs or share new job listings with students, most efforts do not extend beyond this. Codeup has a 100% tuition refund guarantee. This means that if our placement team cannot place you with a job in-field within six months of graduation from a Codeup program, 100% of your paid tuition will be refunded to you.* Colleges and universities do not offer tuition refunds for students who are unsuccessful in gaining employment pertaining to their field of study. For all of our program offerings, we ensure the curriculum consists of updated industry expectations, hands-on experience and taught with a live instructor.

This team ensures you have everything you need to be successful in a Codeup program, and will also ensure you have support through any personal obstacles that may arise.

Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let\u2019s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always. We\u2019re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We\u2019re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered. In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren\u2019t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth. To cultivate inclusive growth, we don\u2019t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town.\u00a0 Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you\u2019re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now.

According to mentalhhealthfirstaid.org, \u201cis a course that teaches you how to identify, understand, and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders.

This might include recognizing something in a meeting, picking up on cues during a casual conversation, or acting on a pattern behavior.\u00a0 Many who go through Codeup\u2019s programs will tell you it is both rewarding and challenging all at the same time.

You should learn all about the cloud and cloud technology!\u00a0As we charge forward into 2022, we recently announced our brand new Cloud Administration Program.\u00a0 This is a 15-week career accelerator that gets you hands-on experience with: You\u2019ll earn two industry-recognized certifications as an AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect Associate. Both are included as part of your tuition. You will learn how to build infrastructure that enables software and data science products, manage cloud deployments, and optimize for cloud performance.\u00a0 Here are 5 reasons why we think you should attend our Cloud Administration program:\u00a0 \u00a0 Located on Rackspace property, our Castle campus has everything you need.\u00a0Tabletop games to play with classmates on break? We got foosball and ping pong!\u00a0Need a drink to quench your thirst? We have complimentary soda, water, and tea.\u00a0 There is also lots of seating across the campus for you to study, have lunch, or even meet with classmates.\u00a0 Parking is free since we are located on Rackspace\u2019s property. You have the option to park about 100 ft away from our building, or you can park on the underground level to save your car from the heat if you attend during the summer months.\u00a0 There is also plenty of food options within driving distance of campus. Fast food options include Mcdonald\u2019s, Panda Express, and Bill Miller\u2019s BBQ. For more sit-down restaurant options, you can visit Applebee\u2019s, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Olive Garden. If you want to bring your lunch we have microwaves and refrigerators to enjoy your lunch on campus.\u00a0 \u00a0 In just 15 weeks you will be on your way to a new career that\u2019s in high demand! That means you won\u2019t have to wait 2 \u2013 4 years like other traditional degree plans to get started in your new career.\u00a0 Is the cost of our program a concern? We totally understand if it is. Our Cloud Administration program is also the most affordable option of our three programs at Codeup if you\u2019re looking to save the most money. It\u2019s also more affordable than a traditional degree.\u00a0 At Codeup we have a dedicated team of Financial Aid and Enrollment managers who will work with you one on one to ensure you have everything you need to pay for your time at Codeup that makes sense for your individual situation.\u00a0 We have grants, scholarships, and student loans for those who qualify.

This mirrors a Glassdoor Median Base salary of $118,999. Glassdoor also notes a job satisfaction rating of 4 out of 5 and over 10K open roles under the title Cloud Engineer.\u00a0 Are you guaranteed a salary like that after graduation? Not necessarily since this was an average salary. However, what that means is you have the potential to get to that level of salary at some point in your new career. Your new skill sets could land you at a larger company like Accenture, EY, or even USAA. On the other hand, you could end up at a small company like a startup or SaaS (software as a service) company.\u00a0 Both of those options will typically give you things like a great health care plan, generous amounts of time off, and additional perks like continuing education and gym discounts. Startups might be a little more unique in their offerings like remote work options, paying for new office equipment, and even potentially paying for an annual company retreat if the company works remotely.\u00a0 \u00a0 According to IT senior managers in a recent Robert Half survey, cloud expertise is the topmost in-demand skill set. This means cloud experts are in high demand and will continue to be as more companies adopt cloud infrastructures. The curriculum you go through in this program won\u2019t stick you to just one lane.

They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you the answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself.

Even at the college level, professors often don\u2019t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability.

You can read our blog when we announced this last year by clicking here.\u00a0 To look back at the past year, we checked in with Marcus Benavidez and Mike Jaime who stayed with Codeup after previously working with the Rackspace Cloud Academy. We also checked in with Dimitri Antoniou who is our VP of Strategic Initiatives and helped with the merger of the two companies. We asked them questions about the current campus, and also what the future may look like at Codeup\u2019s new \u201cCastle\u201d campus.\u00a0 Mike Jamie: Its history! Rackspace and former Rackers were instrumental in jumpstarting the tech industry here in San Antonio. This includes Geekdom, where Codeup was established. The Castle is where Rackspace ultimately decided to call its international headquarters.\u00a0 Marcus Benavidez: The campus is designed with the student experience in mind. This includes the large classrooms and facilities to match. It\u2019s a piece of San Antonio history as it\u2019s on the Rackspace Campus.\u00a0 Dimitri Antoniou: The Castle has been a staple of tech in San Antonio for years. Train new tech employees in high-growth careers like Cloud Administration from the Castle campus is an exciting extension of the legacy of Rackspace\u2019s impact on San Antonio.

Also, the decision to focus on hands-on experience and know-how as opposed to certification exam memorization will better prepare students with practical knowledge. Marcus: Do it. The time to positively impact your life and to create change is now.

What better way to do that than celebrate female authors! These women have written phenomenal books in the tech space to tell their stories. These are women who have walked the walk in the tech world and/or offered unique perspectives to not just women in tech, but women in the workplace. This list goes in no particular order as we believe you should add all of these to your kindle or book library asap. You can click on each book image to take you to a purchase page on Amazon. Let\u2019s dive into the list below: From the book\u2019s description on Amazon: \u201cIn 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world\u2014and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support\u2014Time hailed her as \u201cthe face of change.\u201d Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset, she tells her full story for the first time.\u201d  \u00a0 From the book\u2019s description on Amazon: \u201cThis book describes the experiences and successes of female innovators and entrepreneurs in the still largely male-dominated tech world in twenty candid interviews. It highlights the varied life and career stories that lead these women to the top positions in the technology industry that they are in now. Interviewees include CEOs, founders, and inventors from a wide spectrum of tech organizations across sectors as varied as mobile technology, e-commerce, online education, and video games. Interviewer Danielle Newnham, a mobile startup and e-commerce entrepreneur herself as well as an online community organizer, presents the insights, instructive anecdotes, and advice shared with her in the interviews, including stories about raising capital for one\u2019s start-up, and about the obstacles these women encountered and how they overcame them.\u201d  \u00a0 From the book\u2019s description on Amazon: \u201cBuying groceries, tracking our health, finding a date: whatever we want to do, odds are that we can now do it online. But few of us ask how all these digital products are designed, or why. It\u2019s time we change that. Many of the services we rely on are full of oversights, biases, and downright ethical nightmares. Chatbots that harass women. Signup forms that fail anyone who\u2019s not straight. Social media sites that send peppy messages about dead relatives. Algorithms that put more black people behind bars.\u00a0 Technically Wrong takes an unflinching look at the values, processes, and assumptions that lead to these problems and more. Wachter-Boettcher demystifies the tech industry, leaving those of us on the other side of the screen better prepared to make informed choices about the services we use \u2013 and demand more from the companies behind them.\u201d  \u00a0 From the book\u2019s description on Amazon: \u201cSilicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops for women in tech. Instead, it\u2019s a \u201cBrotopia,\u201d where men hold the cards and make the rules. While millions of dollars may seem to grow on trees in this land of innovation, tech\u2019s aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world. Brotopia reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures even as its companies claim the moral high ground, and how women are speaking out and fighting back. Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao\u2019s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they \u201cwon\u2019t lower their standards\u201d just to hire women. Exposing the flawed logic in common excuses for why tech has long suffered the \u201cpipeline\u201d problem and invests in the delusion of meritocracy, Brotopia also shows how bias coded into AI, internet troll culture, and the reliance on pattern recognition harms not just women in tech but us all, and at an unprecedented scale.\u201d  \u00a0 From the book\u2019s description on Amazon: \u201cThe last twenty years have brought us the rise of the internet, the development of artificial intelligence, the ubiquity of once unimaginably powerful computers, and the thorough transformation of our economy and society. Through it all, Ellen Ullman lived and worked inside that rising culture of technology, and in Life in Code she tells the continuing story of the changes it wrought with a unique, expert perspective. When Ellen Ullman moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s and went on to become a computer programmer, she was joining a small, idealistic, and almost exclusively male cadre that aspired to genuinely change the world. In 1997 Ullman wrote Close to the Machine, the now classic and still definitive account of life as a coder at the birth of what would be a sweeping technological, cultural, and financial revolution. Twenty years later, the story Ullman recounts is neither one of unbridled triumph nor a nostalgic denial of progress. It is necessarily the story of digital technology\u2019s loss of innocence as it entered the cultural mainstream, and it is a personal reckoning with all that has changed, and so much that hasn\u2019t. Life in Code is an essential text toward our understanding of the last twenty years\u2013and the next twenty.\u201d  \u00a0 Let us know your thoughts on this list on social media!

And not only for their products, but also for the certifications they offer. If you\u2019re new to tech, you might be wondering: Do certifications really matter? Welcome to IT Certifications 101! What\u2019s the tl;dr? Certifications are critical to getting past HR for certain roles, but they won\u2019t get you the job. Certifications are official credentials given by companies, institutions, and vendors to verify that you have demonstrated a specific knowledge or skill. They are a stamp of approval from a known brand (like Amazon) saying \u201cThis person knows their stuff.\u201d Certs are used in a lot of industries, including technology. Even within tech, there are dozens of vendors and hundreds of certs. Many roles (including security, system administration, and networking) require certain certs to make it in the door of an interview process. This filter matters for several reasons: it helps narrow down the pool of applicants, it establishes a baseline of shared knowledge or experience across all applicants, and it expedites the process so that employers don\u2019t have to spend as much time vetting basic technical skills. Obtaining certs in IT will provide you with a number of benefits: At the end of the day, certifications are just pieces of paper. They represent your ability to pass a test, not to do a job. Sometimes those things are one and the same, but usually, they are very different. Certifications are like the entrance fee to get into a tournament: you still need to fight your way to the top. And when you\u2019re standing in the ring, it\u2019s better to know how to fight than to have a degree in fighting. Additionally, not all jobs within tech care about certifications at all. For example, there is technically a Java programming certification from Oracle, but it\u2019s almost never required or considered for job applications because it tests very specific, abnormal, and academic concepts that don\u2019t apply to most real-world software development. At Codeup, we like to think of our IT training as CertificationsPLUS, as in \u2013 you get certifications PLUS hands-on experience. Here\u2019s a quick way to think about it: Amazon Web Services has basic certifications called Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. The official Amazon training for these certs is 1 week: 4 days of training and 1 day of exam readiness. The 1-week schedule will present to you mostly everything you need to pass the certification exam, and then it\u2019s on you to go cram and memorize to get ready. Once you pass, you\u2019ll have the cert, but you\u2019ll be a paper tiger: all bark and no bite. In other words, you\u2019ll appear knowledgeable and skillful on paper, but in reality, you won\u2019t have any experience or know-how for completing the real work. Alternatively, Codeup spends 5 weeks on AWS, combining exam study and hands-on practice. That way, you can talk the talk and walk the walk.

Similar attacks are on the rise. This year, 38% more companies have experienced cyber attacks as compared to last year. Often, they involve a ransom payment in order to re-access stolen files. The amount paid by these victims has increased by 300%. In our headquarters of San Antonio, Texas, even local organizations are at risk. Recently, Judson ISD paid a $500,000 ransom. In 2020, there were over 300,000 open roles for cybersecurity professionals in the US. To add to that, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 31% increase in Information Security roles in the upcoming years. As attacks are on the rise, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is quickly increasing. But with so many open roles, the issue isn\u2019t demand \u2013 it\u2019s supply. Luckily, San Antonio is already a national leader in cybersecurity. We have over 16,000 employees in the field, which is the most certified cyber professionals outside of D.C.. With industry giants like USAA and Lockheed Martin in the city, we have a good footing over much of the country. Moreover, San Antonio is Military City, USA. We\u2019re home to one of the largest populations of bases, veterans, and active service members in the country. With both these backgrounds, the city is well-positioned to continue to lead our country\u2019s defense \u2013 not just traditionally, but in cyber warfare as well.  But we still need more help. What can we do about it? Train more cybersecurity professionals. Organizations like Project Quest have supported cybersecurity training for years. But we can\u2019t rely solely on non-profit funding. There are plenty of opportunities for veterans to enter the field with VA benefits. Training programs like Codeup Cloud Academy are approved to accept GI Bill\u00ae and Vocational Rehab. This allows veterans to receive housing support while getting the cybersecurity training they need in our Cyber Cloud program. Want to keep San Antonio safe and positioned as a leader in Cybersecurity? Help us train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals! Connect us with veterans in your network so we can all help continue San Antonio\u2019s tradition of protecting our city and country!"}, {"title": "Use your GI Bill\u00ae benefits to Land a Job in Tech", "content": "As the end of military service gets closer, many transitioning service members often ask, \u201cCan the GI Bill\u00ae pay for a coding bootcamp?\u201d The answer is yes, but only if the coding bootcamp is on the VA-approved list. The GI Bill\u00ae will pay for college or a VA-approved coding bootcamp. For bootcamp programs, the VA uses a formula to calculate how much time to deduct from your benefits based on the program\u2019s tuition and how it compares to average college costs. That\u2019s good news for veterans looking for a second career in the technology sector. The tech industry is fast-paced, action-oriented, and often focused on completing small goals to accomplish large ones, a familiar process for those trained by the military. With average salaries for entry-level programmers averaging around $80,000, it\u2019s a great time to learn how to code and get paid for your expertise. You could always attend a two- or four-year college degree program in computer science and learn software development. Or you could train for these jobs by completing a specialized bootcamp program. Coding bootcamps teach widely used programming languages and frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Python on Django, JavaScript, and PHP stacks through project-based learning. Students graduate from bootcamps with a portfolio, an online presence, interview skills, and more. Most courses even help graduates find an internship or match students with an employer network. A bootcamp is an immersive, intense full-time learning environment. Students should prepare to scale back outside activities and give up full-time employment for the program\u2019s course. Coding bootcamps vary in length from six to 28 weeks, although the average time is about 14 weeks long. Military service members transitioning from active duty to veteran status can often leverage terminal leave to attend a coding bootcamp. If you\u2019re still wondering whether to choose a college program or a tech career accelerator, here are some points to consider: A tech workforce development program usually translates into extensive, hands-on instruction in say, learning how to write code in less time than it takes to complete a two- or four-year degree program. Some bootcamps may be offered through established state or private universities, while some private providers offer training programs. Texas-based Codeup offers accelerated programs in San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, and Houston to help you launch your tech career. No previous experience is needed to participate in any of Codeup\u2019s accelerator programs, all of which are GI Bill\u00ae eligible. Apply to Codeup\u2019s full-stack web development to learn how to create an app or website from start to finish using today\u2019s coding languages in just 20 weeks.Apply to Codeup\u2019s systems engineering bootcamp if you\u2019re up for problem-solving in information technology in this 13-week accelerator.Apply to Codeup\u2019s data science bootcamp if you\u2019d like to be a data scientist and learn how to apply machine learning models to make predictions and turn your insights into actionable recommendations over the course of 20 weeks.

But if you\u2019re new to tech, you might be wondering\u2026what is Systems Engineering? In IT terms, a Systems Engineer (Sysadmin or Sysad for short) is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and operation of computer systems. They manage things like security, storage, automation, troubleshooting, and a whole lot more. For example, some of the day to day tasks include things like: You might be thinking, \u201cWoah, that looks like a lot!\u201d and that\u2019s because it is! A Systems Engineer is a critical piece of IT infrastructure. And in today\u2019s digital age, all companies are IT companies, which means Sysadmins are critical everywhere. You can think of a Sysad as a jack-of-all-trades of what we typically think of as IT. But don\u2019t forget how the old saying actually ends: \u201cA jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none.\u201d So, what are the skills a Sysadmin uses? Now you know what a Sysadmin does and what skills they use. But why become a Sysadmin? The world is increasingly dependent on computer systems and their underlying technologies. Configuring computer software, designing innovative solutions for specific problems, and basic troubleshooting skills are more and more in demand each year.\u00a0 Without systems engineers, the technical world would stop innovating and become stagnant.

I would go from home to home working with children anywhere from 1 year old to 18 years old. After 5 years of the profession, my body was getting tired driving around all the time and I felt overworked. The work was satisfying and I do miss working with the kiddos, but I just felt drained. I knew it was time to find a different field, so I started thinking about what else I was good at. Then one day as I was on my way to a patient\u2019s home, I found a Codeup billboard near Splashtown that said \u201cdrive to a job you love\u201d and I took it as a sign. I thought, \u201cI want to drive to a job I love!\u201d I had also heard nothing but good things about Codeup from a friend that went the Web Development route. She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process. At first, I was a little worried about tuition payment, but once I got started in the application process, they held Zoom meetings where they would talk about all the funding options. They made it really easy and addressed all of my concerns. I realized I didn\u2019t have to be scared about the financial aspect. I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me. I also received a few different scholarships from Codeup. The rest of it was a loan from Meritize. It was difficult leaving something I was comfortable and familiar with to start something new with no data science background, but I have always enjoyed all things tech. Once we got into the pre-assessment work and then the prework leading up to class, it showed me, \u201cokay this IS what I wanted to be doing.\u201d I really enjoyed it, thought it was fun, and realized this was for me. Overall, I really enjoyed the program. We were in Zoom the whole time because of the pandemic, but they made it slow, nice, and easy. The instructors are absolutely wonderful. Every single instructor helped me at one point or another, teaching things from ground zero and explaining everything really nicely in a way I can understand. One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn\u2019t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own. This is extremely valuable as I believe it is the key to success in this field. Now after graduating from Codeup, I\u2019m a Business Intelligence Analyst at Liquid Web. I\u2019ve been here almost three months now and I\u2019m contributing to so many projects. I really feel like a true member of the team. I can figure things out for myself and my bosses are telling me how well I\u2019m doing and how far I\u2019ve come since working here. I didn\u2019t have to ask for much help or training, because Codeup prepared me well and taught me how to learn when I run into skills they don\u2019t teach. It\u2019s been really good. I\u2019m so glad I made this change. It was scary to take that leap of faith, but ultimately, I\u2019m really glad I did. I love my job and I love what I\u2019m doing. If anyone is looking to make a career change and struggling to find their best fit, I recommend looking into Codeup and going through their process.

We are proud to announce that, effective May 2021,  Codeup is a Candidate for Accreditation by The Middle States Association Commission on Secondary Schools (MSA-CSS), which is located at 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (Phone: 267-284-5000). Accrediting bodies provide guidance and best practices for institutions like Codeup, and verify the quality of our education. The MSA-CSS in particular is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. Getting accredited by them would allow us to establish eligibility to participate in federal Title IV student loan programs for adult students.

What happens when you need more explaining or can\u2019t figure out what you did wrong? What if you lose motivation and start to give up? Live, expert, personalized instruction is what will get you through the hard times and to a new career. If you\u2019re serious about changing careers, you gotta have a good instructor. It needs to be a live, responsive instructor with industry experience, that knows how to teach you what you need to know. You\u2019ll need a curriculum that will actually get you your desired job, based on hands-on practice and skill-building rather than theory. It should cover the entire data science pipeline or app development process to prepare you for the work you will do in-field. The classroom size must be small enough so that you get the individualized attention you deserve. Instructors need to be as invested as you are in setting you up for a successful career and motivate you if you start to give up. Luckily, you can find the best of the best instructors at Codeup. They range in industry experience from entry-level to senior-level. However, even those that are more entry-level may be senior-level educators or senior-level in a particular topic of the curriculum. With a diverse staff of instructors that all shine in different areas of expertise, you\u2019ll have a built-out team that can provide the most value and mentorship to you. Better a full team of experts than a jack of all trades but master of none. Not only will you have expert instructors, but they also really care about you. In college, professors often don\u2019t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. At other bootcamps, you won\u2019t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live, interactive lecture and lab. However, Codeup instructors are like personal mentors. They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you an answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself. They are all responsive and engaging, with a commitment to your success and a mission of empowering life change.\u00a0 Feel ready to make a career change with a team of mentors to help guide you through it? Your mentor instructors will make sure you understand everything, are there when you reach a roadblock, and will keep you accountable to your learning with project-based assignments on a curriculum inspired by employers.

That\u2019s what I would have told you, anyway. On the surface, I was put together. I graduated magna cum laude with a 3.8 in Molecular Biology, had professor recommendations under my belt, and a clear goal to apply for a PhD program in Clinical Psychology. But as I sat in the dry Colorado sunshine on graduation day, this thought popped into my head: \u201cI never have to go to school EVER again\u2026\u201d As soon as I crossed the finish line, it nauseated me to think about going back to school right away.\u00a0 But I felt lost. If I wasn\u2019t going to graduate school, I didn\u2019t have a plan anymore. What the hell was I supposed to do? Being naive and idealistic, I considered applying to the Peace Corps. My brother-in-law (bless his heart) sat me down and explained that the beginning of my career was critical. He also mentioned that it takes about a year to save up for a year of not working; otherwise, I\u2019d have to keep depending on my parents who had already supported me through college.\u00a0 Being bratty and unaware of how the world works, I rolled my eyes at his perfectly logical explanations, convinced he was obsessed with making money. I sat on my high horse, lauding myself for being willing to make a sacrifice when I literally had nothing to my name.\u00a0 In reality, I felt lost. I didn\u2019t recognize it at the time, but going to the Peace Corps was an excuse to run away from uncertainty. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do in life, and I also had these lofty dreams of maybe starting my own business one day or being a part of a movement that mattered. Sensing these hopes in me, my brother-in-law mentioned he had seen billboards around town for a coding bootcamp named Codeup. If I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to \u201cdo\u201d, then maybe I could build my skillset instead.\u00a0 My interest was piqued. Coding seemed cool. I pictured savvy devs in cute plaid shirts and man buns, and being able to live the #vanlife and become a digital nomad. (are you noticing my habit of being idealistic yet?). Buoyed by this vision, I jumped all-in. I told myself I\u2019d go to every happy hour, mixer, network like crazy, and bond with every single one of my classmates.\u00a0 It worked. I landed a job in software development at a cloud security company in Dallas. After spending a year in the Engineering department of my company, I had finally come to face the reality that I wasn\u2019t very good at coding. More importantly, I was pretty apathetic about mastering it. If I continued down my career path as a developer, I\u2019d have to keep learning and keeping up with the latest trends in development, and nothing in me felt excited about that.\u00a0 I was given an opportunity to join the Marketing department as a Digital Marketing Manager. At first, I felt guilty for even considering it. Did my parents spend their hard-earned money putting me through Codeup, only for me to give it all up because I was bored? It seemed like a sin straight out of the immigrant rulebook. My dream to love what I do was \u201cselfish\u201d and having a sense of purpose was a \u201cluxury\u201d. Eventually though, I braced myself and took the leap. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. I finally felt like I was \u201cwith my people\u201d, a collection of brainy empaths with crazy ideas. I learned so much about marketing in general, which allowed me to start up my side business as a coach. I launched my first group coaching course in 2020, and I\u2019m writing a book to release at the start of 2022. I\u2019m living my dream every day, learning and growing with exciting things at every turn. I\u2019ve connected with other coaches, and built a supportive web of connections across the globe. I can\u2019t believe how far I\u2019ve come.\u00a0 But I couldn\u2019t have done it without first building my skills. In a world that penalizes people for not fitting into a neat career category, it can sometimes get confusing for people who have lots of interests. But I realized I didn\u2019t get here by\u00a0trying\u00a0to become a business owner or learn about marketing. I was just, A, open to the opportunity, and B, perfectly positioned to do so.\u00a0 Going through Codeup was a huge incentive for the Marketing manager to hire me, despite the fact I had ZERO marketing experience. They figured, hey, if she can learn full-stack in four months, she can definitely learn the lay of the land in marketing. My exposure to marketing gave me the necessary courage and skills to start getting my content out there. I was writing blogs, publishing podcasts, and releasing YouTube videos. With a clear mission and vision in mind, everything fell into place. It\u2019s not that I suddenly have everything figured out; instead, I\u2019ve gotten used to the uncertainty.\u00a0 I no longer worry about what my career is going to be. I know it\u2019s not going to be \u201cone thing\u201d. I won\u2019t be a coder, a writer, or a coach. I\u2019ll be a coder-writer-coach-podcaster-marketer-salesperson-youtuber-novelist. Why choose, when I know I can make money from my unique mix of skills? Society often suggests we have to choose. But I refuse to believe that anymore.\u00a0 If you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re uncertain about where you\u2019re headed, it\u2019s\u00a0okay\u00a0not to have all the answers. Take things day by day. Build your skillset. Follow what you love. Aim for mastery.\u00a0 And don\u2019t rule out the 9-to-5 doing something you may not love. Your job doesn\u2019t have to be your passion. A steady paycheck does wonders for anxiety and allows you to be creative and innovate in your side-hustles.\u00a0 Practice gratitude. Realize that, yes, things could be worse, but they can also be better. Be patient with learning to wobble on the thin line stretched between \u201cThis is enough\u201d and \u201cI wonder what would happen if\u2026\u201d Go down the rabbit holes. Be curious. And realize that life is about embracing the possibilities. Who knows where it can lead?

Our first Coding is for Women event was a space for women interested in coding to come together (virtually) and learn from each other. Women tuned in from New York, Washington, New Mexico, and of course, our home base of Texas.\u00a0 The panelists for this event were two members of our instructional staff with experience working in the tech industry. Here\u2019s what they had to say about the barriers, opportunities, and overall experience getting into and working in tech! \u00a0 Madeleine: I graduated from Codeup\u2019s first Data Science cohort, worked as a Data Scientist for about 2 years, and now I\u2019m back as a Data Science instructor! I love this institution [Codeup] and can\u2019t stay away from it. Jasmine: I graduated from Codeup\u2019s Web Development program last June. Now, I\u2019m working at Codeup as a Graduate Fellow, and have a part-time job as a React Native developer. \u00a0 Madeleine: I was a Starbucks barista and supervisor for 11 years. I went to college on and off, changed my major about 8 times, and had a two-year gap period. It was a long process by I ended up getting a Mathematics degree. I couldn\u2019t find a way to utilize it, so that\u2019s when I started looking into bootcamps. As soon as I graduated from Codeup, I immediately began working at Booz Allen Hamilton for a couple years. Jasmine: I was a Pharmacy Technician for about 7 years. I started as a cashier and worked my way up. I reached a point where there was no where else I could go. The next step would\u2019ve been Pharmacist which I didn\u2019t want to do, so I decided to pursue tech instead. \u00a0 Jasmine: As a pharm tech, I realized I was more interested in the software we were using than the medicine, and didn\u2019t want to deal with the general public. I became curious about why the little Java coffee cup was popping up on my screen every day and started getting interested in the behind-the-scenes of the platform we were using. I knew that I could do it because there are a lot of transferable skills between the two careers. Madeleine: I got some experience programming in college, but it sat in the background and didn\u2019t mesh well with my degree. After college, I realized I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with my degree so I started working aimlessly, not knowing what to do. As much as I sincerely loved the service industry, it\u2019s almost impossible to make a sustainable living. I wanted to start utilizing my skills more. I heard about data science but didn\u2019t know what it meant. I looked into it more right as Codeup was opening their Data Science program. It was the perfect fit to make use of\u00a0 my math, programming, and natural creative storytelling skills. \u00a0 Jasmine: I graduated Codeup after the pandemic struck, and the job search started to feel really isolating. I found this support group of women who would meet up every week, talk about the job search, what leads we had, troubles we were having, and made connections that led to the job I have now. So, it\u2019s really important to find community and find support during the hard times. The women in tech groups are strong support communities and support systems! Madeleine: It was an old friend from high school, actually. After college, when I wasn\u2019t really doing anything, we had reconnected. He had just signed up for a bootcamp, which was actually formerly Rackspace Cloud Academy, which is now Codeup Cloud Academy. He helped me understand how bootcamps can fill in the gaps of traditional academia, which tends to fail at helping people find satisfying careers. Then once I was in Codeup, I got so much guidance from the instructors and career advisors that I am very, very grateful for. \u00a0 Madeleine: It was extremely daunting. I was shoved into this tech world after working in coffee shops my whole life. Booz Allen is a firm full of extremely talented people. I taught myself cybersecurity on my own. The other data scientists before me were a Doctor of Computer Science and an Astrophysicist. So, I was sitting here with my Bachelor\u2019s degree and a bootcamp certificate thinking \u201cokay, I hope I got this.\u201d It turned out Codeup prepared way more than I anticipated in that context, where I was able to use my tools from Codeup to identify flaws in the methodologies that were being used. I was able to improve it on a pretty quick turnaround. I was really able to secure my footing and get a good reputation in the field before I even felt confident in what I was doing. The imposter syndrome may never really goes away but it was great to see that I can use the tools that I\u2019ve learned even though I\u2019m doubting myself. \u00a0 Jasmine: In my current role, I\u2019m using a technology that we didn\u2019t learn at Codeup, but Codeup taught me how to learn so I\u2019m learning! I feel the imposter syndrome almost every day.\u00a0 I definitely felt like \u201cWhat am I doing here? I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Some advice I was given, and has helped me a lot, is keeping track of accomplishments you\u2019ve done on the job. It\u2019s great to look back on and see how much you can do and have done. \u00a0 Jasmine: Learn how to learn. That\u2019s how you\u2019re going to get ahead, and that\u2019s something I really learned at Codeup. We couldn\u2019t learn everything, but when you learn how to learn, you can learn anything on your own. Madeleine:\u00a0 You can\u2019t learn everything! Don\u2019t overburden yourself with what you should or could know. Keep studying what you enjoy naturally, persist, keep practicing. It may be hard to find a job but keep practicing. Don\u2019t undervalue networking. \u00a0 Madeleine: You will have technical interviews. What gets in the way for interviewers is a perceived lack of confidence. If you can\u2019t sell yourself in that way, everything else as far as technical knowledge comes to a halt. Keep track of everything you can do as far as technical skills. Be able to fill dead air and answer questions even if you don\u2019t know the answer. If you get to a question you don\u2019t know, try to probe the interview to get to a mutual point that you do know. Try to slice through ambiguity, and have general conversational skills. Even if you can\u2019t answer it directly, you can get to a point where you can elaborate on something you\u2019re interested in tangentially, or connect with the interviewer in a different way. It could show off some other suspect of your talent, or at the very least, show confidence. Jasmine: At the end of the day, companies want to hire someone that will make a contribution. One way to show that is by doing your research on the interviewer and the company. Who are the higher-ups, who has been hired recently? Show that you are interested in them. \u00a0 Jasmine: Keep a spreadsheet of every single job you\u2019ve applied to, what resume you sent them, and where you found them. Look for communities that you identify with and network with them. I am in a group for Latinx people in tech. When I\u2019m being really targeted with looking for positions within my community, I get a better response. Madeleine: Get involved in communities! Geekdom is a great place. I am involved in the Queer community in San Antonio. You might find yourself networking in places you didn\u2019t initially expect, but get involved, and try to be as engaged as possible. Be yourself and show your personality if you want people to remember you. Women might be expected to be more demure, or submissive in the way they present themselves. But there\u2019s a balance between not being perceived as aggressive, and still showing that you are confident in your skills or your personality.\u00a0 \u00a0 Jasmine: Go to a bootcamp! I was pretty self-motivated but I still wanted more of a push, more of a community, and structure. Codeup is a great way to learn how to code, but it\u2019s not like riding a bike! You will forget how to code if you don\u2019t code. Stay on it so you don\u2019t fall off. Madeleine: I\u2019m a big fan of Codecademy if you\u2019re just trying to get your feet wet and see if you like it. For data science, Data Camp is a great resource as well. Codecadamy can also help with Codeup\u2019s Python pre-work and challenges during the admissions process. \u00a0 Jasmine: In my experience, employers expect that as a Junior Developer, you\u2019re still learning and you are going to have to learn some things on the job. They don\u2019t expect you to know everything, but they do expect you to be willing to learn and ready to hop in. In my position, I\u2019m learning a new programming language on the job. At Codeup, you\u2019ll learn how to learn a language quickly, and you can take that with you for when you get hired. Madeleine: When I was at my previous company, I had to learn Deep Learning and Cybersecurity very quickly. They helped me out with getting certifications and offering stipends for learning resources. But conversely, when I wanted to grow personally in my data science skills, that was all self-taught and on my own time and from my network. \u00a0 Huge \u201cthank you\u201d to Madeleine and Jasmine for joining us as panelists for this event! They\u2019ve offered a wide wealth of resources and experiences to grow and learn from. To recap major points, learn how to learn, keep practicing, become confident in your skills, and be yourself when you network. There are plenty of female coders out there, and plenty of communities to join to meet like-minded women. Here in Texas, Women Who Code has communities in Austin, Dallas, and Houston.

The top 2 Best Jobs in 2021 just happen to coincide with the two programs we have at Codeup! A true coincidence? We think not. We know what jobs are in demand, and what jobs will see growth well into the future. Let\u2019s take a look at what these jobs are and why they top the list! \u00a0 The #1 Best Job is not Software Developer, Software Engineer, or Computer Scientist. It is specifically Java Developer. What does this mean? A Java Developer is a developer whose work is largely focused on Java, which is both a programming language and a platform for application development. Many companies, including LinkedIn, Indeed, and Twitter, rely on Java for their websites. Java Developers are responsible for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining Java applications. Such applications might include gaming websites, e-commerce websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, and more. What you will be by the time you graduate Codeup is a full-stack web developer. You will have learned to build web-based applications using Java, but it isn\u2019t the only tool in your toolbox. You\u2019ll also be comfortable coding with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and can integrate various coding languages to develop an application. You will know about front-end technologies, back-end technologies, and will be able to work in either one or both. Click here to view our curriculum. Java Developers are much less focused on design, and much more focused on the program architecture. This role has a heavier focus on computer science, and the coding is limited mostly to Java. Codeup students that particularly loved their 100+ hours in Java might decide to specialize, and seek out a Java Developer role. Why is it the best? Glassdoor determined the Best Jobs in 2021 based on number of job openings, salary, and overall job satisfaction. Java Developers have 10,103 job openings on Glassdoor. Most of the other jobs ranked on this list have under 10,000 job openings, and about half have less than 5,000. The median base salary across all levels of Java Developers is $90,830. The overall job satisfaction is 4.2 out of 5. This role is in-demand by employers, rated highly for job satisfaction, and pays very well. \u00a0 The #2 Best Job is not Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, or Business Analyst. It is a Data Scientist. A Data Scientist (capital D, capital S) is a specific role that requires work across the entire data science pipeline. However, there are a number of roles a data scientist (lowercase D, lowercase S) can take! Their job title may not be \u201cData Scientist\u201d but they can still work throughout the data science pipeline. However, they might choose to specialize in one area based on their own preferences or business needs, and take on a role like a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Analytics Specialist. After Codeup, you will be a data scientist. You\u2019ve been trained and have gained experience working throughout the entire data science pipeline, including data wrangling, which many programs neglect. Our collective goal is for you to be hire-able as a Data Scientist, but many grads end up taking a more specific role. Other alumni job titles include Business Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and People Analytics Specialist. To learn more about the various careers in data science, based on our alumni\u2019s job titles, check out the blog \u201cWhat Data Science Career is for You?\u201d Why is it the second best? As mentioned above, Glassdoor decides these rankings based on number of job openings, salary, and overall job satisfaction. There are 5,971 job openings on Glassdoor for Data Scientists. The median base salary for Data Scientists of all levels is $113,736. The job satisfaction rating is 4.1 out of 5. This is a very high paying role with high satisfaction rankings. In fact, it topped the Best Jobs list for four consecutive years until 2020! While the number of job openings for Data Scientists may not look terribly high, the growth rate is 31%, which is very high! Keep in mind, too, that Glassdoor is counting the jobs for Data Scientists, and not all the millions of positions that a data scientist might specialize in. \u00a0 There\u2019s certainly a reason these are the two programs we teach here at Codeup! They are the best jobs out there, in booming industries, and in very high demand for employers. They can also offer lots of stability, flexibility, and work-life balance. No wonder they\u2019re the 2 Best Jobs of 2021! Thinking about becoming a Java Developer for web-based applications?

Similarly, losing existing employees causes incalculable losses on institutional knowledge and team morale. Given that 71% of recent college grads leave their first job within their first year, modern employers face a crisis of confidence in hiring employees who are ready to commit. Fortunately, you can hire for the long haul with Codeup candidates that are ready to commit to growing in your company. The average tenure of Codeup graduates in their first job is 22 months (2014-2019), almost double the norm for college grads. That means that for every Codeup grad you hire and employ, you would have to hire and employ TWO college graduates, resulting in more than double your HR costs. 53% of Codeup graduates hired after graduation are STILL employed at their first company. That means for more than half of your hires, you could hire an employee who sticks with you indefinitely.\u00a0 Between 2014-2021, 90% of Codeup graduates hired after graduation are still employed in their fields of study. More broadly, most people change jobs 12 times throughout their career. You could hire someone who\u2019s about to make 3 more career hops, or you could hire someone who is 9 times out of 10 landing in their final career change. Employers face a shifting workforce with shorter tenure, more job hopping, and less company loyalty, all of which add up to increased costs and decreased performance. Why do Codeup grads differ so drastically? Save recruitment costs, increase employee tenure, and hire employees who want to join you for the long haul.  Ready to hire for the long haul?

Fortunately, when you know who you\u2019re hiring, you can improve your odds and further mitigate that risk. We can help! When you hire from Codeup, you know who you\u2019re hiring.

No. Even when counting cards, there are no absolutes, but you can still play a much smarter hand.\u00a0 On top of those baseline qualifications, you are sourcing candidates from a pool of hungry and motivated developers, in which your future CTO or Lead Developer might be floating.

Chances are, you\u2019re looking for a way to make use of your particular talents, a field that\u2019s secure and reliable, a work/life balance, and good compensation. For the right people, data science offers all of that and more! It was LinkedIn\u2019s #1 Most Promising Job in 2019, and Glassdoor\u2019s 2nd Best Job of 2021! Actually, Data Scientists topped that list from 2016 to 2019 before being dethroned by developers, which we also train at Codeup. So why all the hype? What makes it the best? Keep reading to learn why you should become a Data Scientist! \u00a0 Do your colleagues hate you for overanalyzing things? Have you found yourself turning everything into a spreadsheet? Do you make your life decisions based on careful calculations using past data? You might thrive as a data scientist!\u00a0 This is the first section on our list because data science isn\u2019t for everyone, and it\u2019s important to consider where your strengths and interests actually lie. If you don\u2019t have a penchant for numbers and historical patterns, or if careful analysis bores you, this may not be for you. For some people, though, data science is fascinating, rewarding, and a great way to make use of their talents and natural thought processes. Check out how much our students love what they do every week in this blog post.\u00a0 \u00a0 The field is booming, the demand is high, and the job is the best. 2020 was the first year since 2016 that Data Scientist was not the number one job in America, according to Glassdoor. Now it sits at Number 2, but rest assured, the growth and demand show no signs of slowing down. Since 2012, there has been a 650% increase in data science positions. However, the supply of data scientists remains relatively low. Sure, it\u2019s been the number 1 job for a while now and people are catching on, but more and more positions are also opening, so supply isn\u2019t actually catching up to the demand. At least, for qualified data scientists. One reason for the continued low supply is that prospective data scientists who go traditional routes are often stuck in school for 2-4 years. Meanwhile, the demands and technologies are changing rapidly, so what they are learning risks being outdated by the time they graduate. Another reason is that a Master\u2019s Degree does not in and of itself prepare grads with the skills needed for the job, or even just to nail their technical interviews. They might learn about data science for years, but if they don\u2019t practice it, don\u2019t have a repository that they push to regularly, haven\u2019t built a data pipeline, don\u2019t have project experience, etc., they aren\u2019t ready to work as a data scientist. This lack of post-grad readiness is another contributor to the low supply, despite many graduate students thinking they\u2019re ready for the job search. (Thinking of getting a Master\u2019s Degree? Learn more, here.) Altogether, this makes a trained data scientist all the more valuable, relatively rare, and in very high demand. So, you know that demand is high now and that properly qualified data scientists (with flexible demands) will have no trouble finding a job. But you don\u2019t just want a job now, you want a career for the long haul. Is this just a trend that\u2019s going to fizzle out? Unlikely. Will this still be a secure path in the future, say 10 or 20 years down the road? All the data say yes! The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists Data Scientists as one of the fastest-growing occupations. They project a 31% growth rate with nearly 12 million new jobs between 2019 and 2029. More and more companies will have no choice but to start using data-driven decision making, lest they risk being put out of business by their data savvy competitors. Artificial intelligence (AI), a subset of data science, alone is creating millions of jobs! However, it\u2019s also wiping out over a million jobs. Want to make sure your skillset stays in-demand? Start a career with job security. Employers will always need humans to program the machines, understand the data pipeline, write the algorithms used by AI, and continue maintaining the tech and the data. Many of Codeup\u2019s career transitioners know what it\u2019s like to work in oilfields, call centers, food service, sales, retail, and teaching. The ones that don\u2019t require manual labor or being on your feet all day still require odd hours, lots of emotional exertion, or giving up weekends. Some people love this sort of work, but others are missing that work/life balance. Work/life balance is something that\u2019s completely subjective based on where you are in your life, how much you enjoy your work, how much is required of you, and so on. With a career in tech, you will very likely be working at a desk from 8 or 9am to 5 or 6pm with weekends off. You won\u2019t be manual laboring, rushing to get someone to cover your shift, stressing about getting in hours, or speaking to customers or children all day long. Will some days be more stressful than others? Are you going to have to stay late sometimes to meet deadlines? Will you spend some of your \u201cfree\u201d time learning the newest technologies? Yes. But for the most part, you can relax. You\u2019ll have a steady work schedule, an average stress level, above-average flexibility should you need to adjust your schedule or take time off, and you will almost always have evenings and the weekends to yourself or to spend time with family and friends. Interested in boosting your earning potential? Data science is a lucrative field with a highly valuable skillset. You could potentially double your current salary with your very first in-field job. Your employer might also cover health insurance, provide retirement contributions, and offer flexible paid time off. Entry-level data scientists have some of the highest starting salaries around, with averages of: And it\u2019s only upward from there as your career progresses. In San Antonio, which is where our headquarters are, we\u2019re seeing salary averages of: Want to start earning six figures within a few years? Become a data scientist. With just a few years of experience, your talent becomes much more valuable. Keep reading to see how long it takes to advance. In the tech field, room for growth is limitless. There are always new technologies to learn and adapt to, new skills to perfect along the data pipeline, and career opportunities abound. The next step after beginning your career as a Junior Data Scientist is often Senior Data Scientist, which is the middle level. Typically, this requires 3-5 years of relevant work experience and the abilities to write reusable code, formulate machine learning algorithms, and build strong data pipelines in cloud environments.\u00a0 After senior is the top level, the most experienced member of the data science team. You may see them referred to with different titles, such as Vice President, Director, Head, or Chief. They lead the data science team, have over 5 years of experience, and are fluent or very well-versed along the data science pipeline. This person knows best practices for building and deploying a predictive model, can efficiently write code, and will know the highest impact projects to work on (TowardsDataScience). \u00a0 So, you\u2019ve got a booming industry, a secure field, a skill set that\u2019s in high demand, the ability to advance your career, a lucrative salary, a solid work/life balance, and to top it off, you get to do what you\u2019re good at and passionate about. No wonder it\u2019s the best job out there! If you enjoy working with data, this could be an incredibly fulfilling career path.

Diversity in employment isn\u2019t only a simplistic comparison of race and gender. Those are, of course, critical demographics to focus on when leveling the playing field, but they are only two. People often forget about other variables like age, educational background, military service, physical ability, and work history. Hiring diverse talent means more than splitting your team 50/50 and calling it a day; it means introducing and empowering as many divergent identities, experiences, and perspectives as possible. Take a minute to reflect on your own team. How many non-male individuals are there? How many non-white and non-male individuals work on your team? Do you work alongside any military veterans? Have you interviewed any LGBTQIA, alternative education, or disabled individuals? When you expand your definition and begin to think about the intersectionality of identity, building a diverse team gets a lot more complicated than hiring out of a CS program.

We interviewed him and his boss so you can learn how Codeup paid off for both employee and employer! Stan: I was living in San Antonio at the time and looking for a way to refresh my skills and become more marketable in the IT sector after working overseas for a long time. Codeup was the most attractive option and was right in the city. \u00a0 \u00a0 Stan: Be honest with yourself about your skill set and don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions to senior devs at the company. Even if those questions perhaps seem like things you think you should know or you think they expect you to know. Don\u2019t let imposter syndrome get the best of you. If the company knows you came from a coding bootcamp, they should know that you are not the finished product and will require mentoring. Having said that, it is up to you to make sure you get that mentoring and ensure you keep on improving and building on top of what you learned at Codeup. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Stan: I think one of the biggest advantages that a Codeup grad has is having Codeup in their corner.

You and apparently millions of others! The COVID-19 pandemic has seen college in decline and bootcamps on the rise as people flock to shorter-term options that offer a clear career path and a marketable skillset. For some, it\u2019s the newfound financial strain causing them to realize they need a new career ASAP and can\u2019t spend 4 years and $50k to get it. A recent Wall Street Journal article even wonders, \u201cIs This the End of College as We Know It?\u201d Keep reading for our interpretation. \u00a0 College is generally accepted as the thing to do after high school, but it wasn\u2019t always that way. The \u201ccollege for all\u201d campaign originated during the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s, when college was a luxury for the rich. It caused a racial and classist divide as those that couldn\u2019t afford it took on trades. However, college is still a luxury for the rich. Only now, those that can\u2019t afford it have to fight for scholarships and grants or bear the burden of student loan repayment for three, four, sometimes five or more decades. Thanks to student loan repayment, many feel forced to postpone life milestones, unable to finance a house or children while catching up on debt. In the midst of a pandemic, that financial strain is a risk people are more hesitant to take. What\u2019s the point of college, anyhow? Why insist that everyone should go even if it causes financial strain for decades? Well, because it\u2019s supposed to give us the education we need to be successful, prepare us for the working world, and get us to a job where we can make use of our degree right after college. For the lucky few, that actually happened. The rest didn\u2019t get the Return on Investment they hoped for. After college, they struggled to find their way, often winding up in career paths that don\u2019t require their degree, but all the while, continuing to pay for it. A promised not delivered? Not exactly, because there was never a legal promise, just advice from everyone around them. An unfortunate debt and learning experience? Some may call it that. So if not college, then what? Many are going against the grain, saving tens of thousands of dollars and years of their life in the process. Who\u2019s profiting? Institutions that offer short-term training in a marketable skill, and their students. The pandemic has loomed upon us for about a year now, and in that year, short-term credential classes saw an enrollment spike of 8 million students, a 70% increase from just before COVID-19. Meanwhile, enrollment of freshmen in college dropped 16%. Going this route, even students are profiting, as they\u2019re able to start earning income much faster. While short-term classes in more traditional trade careers, like electricians, mechanics, plumbing, and some health care professions have been around since 1879, coding bootcamps are really at the heart of this spike. They\u2019re newer and more enticing to the emerging adults of Gen Z. They help millennials right the wrongs of their post-grad plans not working out. Even older generations are seeing the shift to a technical world and want in. \u00a0 Our aim here at Codeup is to develop the workforce, our mission to empower life change. While we can\u2019t speak to any other coding schools\u2019 mission, their aim is more or less the same. College provides a place to learn while coding bootcamps and trade schools provide a clear path into a career. College provides an often broad and philosophical education, covering a wide array of topics like history, science, and liberal arts, with a focus on whatever we are interested in. Coding bootcamps and trade schools prepare you for one thing and one thing only, with a focus on in-demand careers. It\u2019s everything you need to know, and nothing you don\u2019t.

Every company needs an interactive website with an equally interactive mobile version to stay afloat.\u00a0 While traditionally brick and mortar companies remove storefronts and go paperless, human-facing staff are being downsized in favor of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automatic, responsive applications (think salespeople and customer service agents). However, they will always need people to program that AI, code the applications, and protect all the new networks and infrastructure from being hacked. Job security is one thing you won\u2019t have to worry much about as a skilled developer. There truly are not enough in the market, and you can help bridge that gap while also building a fulfilling career! \u00a0 Reason #2 of why you should become a web developer is to have the security and stability you\u2019ve always wanted. As mentioned earlier, the ever-growing need for developers will ensure your job security for years to come, so long as you stay up to date with the newest languages (more on that later). It\u2019s no secret that landing your first developer job is going to be tough. That\u2019s true whether you\u2019re a Computer Science grad, a bootcamp grad, or self-taught. (Codeup does everything we can to streamline your job hunt.) But once you\u2019re in, you will rarely find yourself out of a job. Web developers boast a tiny unemployment rate of 2.5%. That feeling of knowing your skillset will be in demand well into the future is priceless. \u00a0 It\u2019s a career, not a job, and your compensation and benefits will reflect such. Gone are the days of clocking in and out for bathroom breaks, not seeing your family, being called in, and asking to work overtime to get more hours. Welcome to the days of a stable and flexible work schedule, health insurance, retirement contributions, and a good salary! The average starting salaries are: Those are some good looking numbers for your very first development job. And salary offers drastically increase after you pass \u201centry level.\u201d Average salaries are: Senior Web Developers have at least 5 years of experience, but some companies require more. Even still, there\u2019s potential to nearly double your salary in just a couple years. A few years more and six figures, here you come! \u00a0 Look, coding is tough stuff! You can equate it to learning Spanish, then German, then all of a sudden, French is all the rage. Meanwhile, your colleagues may speak it a little differently than you, using a different word order to deliver the same message. This career path is one of continuous learning and evolution: This career path is for highly motivated individuals that are okay with constant learning, shifting, and growth. \u00a0 Job satisfaction is an ambiguous thing to measure. Some things that go into it are job security, compensation, ability to grow, and personal fulfillment, all of which we touch on here. Other elements are work/life balance, quality of leadership, colleagues, and appreciation from others, which vary from person to person and from job to job. You\u2019ll be happy to know that the majority of developers, at a whopping 63%, are satisfied with their jobs. (That\u2019s much higher than the national average of 51%!) \u00a0 Lots of developers think of their job as a hobby, like mastering an instrument or a sport. It can be very personally fulfilling. For some, they\u2019re creative and innovative. They enjoy being at the forefront of tech and bringing ideas to life. It\u2019s an exciting place to be! Others fully embrace their analytical skills, and love the idea of seeing performance results whenever they run their code. If it runs, fabulous. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s a problem they enjoy solving. Is it frustrating sometimes? Yes. Is it also very rewarding when it finally works the way they intend? Absolutely. Thinking more externally, can the applications you make truly make a difference in someone\u2019s life? Definitely! When you\u2019re a web developer working with the right team toward the right mission, you might love it so much you\u2019d do it for free (hypothetically, of course). \u00a0 So why should you become a web developer? It\u2019s a solid career path with high compensation and high demand that will grant you the stability, security, and confidence we all long for. Going one step further, you can meet your full potential in a position with constant growth and high job satisfaction, where creative minds can embrace their creativity and analytical minds can embrace their problem-solving skills. Feel fulfilled, confident, accomplished, and secure. Start today, be a web developer in 6 months! Apply now! Future you will thank you."}, {"title": "Codeup 2020 Year in Review", "content": "Finally, 2021 is here! While of course 2020 had its downs, we\u2019d like to reflect on the silver linings and victories we had. It was actually a very big year for Codeup, as you\u2019ll see in this Codeup 2020 Year in Review! With virtual learning, we were able to deliver our mission to people all across Texas, not just at our physical campuses. Our staff grew exponentially. We launched two campuses and a new scholarship for Black and African-American students. We were named on Inc. 5000\u2019s fastest-growing companies. We now offer total confidence for employers that hire our grads with a Salary Refund Guarantee. We\u2019ve been growing our employer network all across the country due to remote opportunities. We launched an online store to raise funds for scholarships. Thanks to virtual graduation days, we now have video evidence of what students can accomplish by the end of Codeup. We\u2019ve continued to show our immense support of new students and graduates with curbside swag pickups on Welcome Days, and celebratory pinata kits on graduation days. Best of all, we empowered life change for 161 individuals. It has been a year of growth for staff, students, and our community. This is our first time living through a global pandemic, which brought quite a lot more firsts. Looking at the Codeup 2020 Year in Review, we feel incredibly grateful that we were able to achieve so much this year. It all goes toward our mission of empowering life change, which we are now able to do on a much grander scale. If 2020 wasn\u2019t your year, make 2021 the year you land your dream job. Reach out to us if you\u2019re ready to have a year full of growth, too!"}, {"title": "Oops I Got a Degree In\u2026", "content": "Is your degree not getting you the job prospects you hoped for? Having doubts about college? Accidentally study Wizardry for four years? We have heard many stories about degrees that didn\u2019t pan out long term. At our event \u201cOops I Got a Degree In\u2026,\u201d Codeup Data Science alumni Nicole Garza and Jesse Ruiz were living proof that your degree doesn\u2019t have to box you in. Our Director of Marketing and Admissions, who studied Health and Exercise Science, led a discussion on how their seemingly non-relevant degrees got them to where they are now. Keep reading to see how Jesse went from Ivy League graduate to Codeup alumna, and how Nicole went from interning for the mayor to building up a data science department. \u00a0 Nicole: My name is Nicole and I have a degree in Political Science with a minor in Sociology. Jesse: I\u2019m Jesse. I have an undergraduate degree in Philosophy, then studied Fine Arts in graduate school. \u00a0 Nicole: I interned for the mayor\u2019s office, but you need a certain personality type to do politics. I\u2019d rather be behind a screen. Jesse: I was an artist and taught art. It was a really fun and amazing opportunity but it wasn\u2019t financially secure.\u00a0 \u00a0 Nicole: I did some jobs where I had to work with data, descriptive statistics, and a database. Then I got interested in pursuing that at a higher level. Jesse: With my degree in Philosophy at an Ivy League, I got lots of training in analytical thinking and study habits. I did well in calculus and physics, and being an artist took a huge amount of self-discipline and creativity. I see all of those things largely in data science. \u00a0 Nicole: Both my brothers are developers, and software developers are a great resource to help understand the coding part of data science. Some courses in my undergrad had a heavy emphasis on research, data, and statistical analysis and I remembered that I enjoyed those. Jesse: I started searching for other career opportunities and took a lot of quizzes about what the best career is for your personality. I did a lot of research in the field and consulted my cousin who is a software developer. It took me about a year of part-time self-teaching for me to actually understand the field. \u00a0 Nicole: Take a short online class to see if it\u2019s something you\u2019d perhaps enjoy. Something very simple and basic. Talk to people in the field. Think about past courses or experiences that you enjoyed or were good at.\u00a0 Jesse: Take a predetermined period of time taking some courses and harnessing your network. Talk to your cousin that\u2019s in the field, or the career services at your alma mater to think through your options with someone else. \u00a0 Nicole: The job I was at before Codeup wasn\u2019t for me. It was very repetitive and I wanted something different, more creative, something that would get the wheels of my mind turning. I started researching options and wanted something that started at a beginner level. Then shortly after, Codeup announced their new data science program. I did some research on it, took the tests and the rest is history! Jesse: It takes a leap of faith. At the time, I was going through some health issues. I was worried about not having health insurance and living at home with my mom and barely making enough money. Codeup has done a great job of helping students work through even the really serious aspects of the decision-making process. I gave myself a year of researching and studying, and then I got funding. When I got funding there was no turning back, I was gonna do this. I think about if I would have done the program if I didn\u2019t have funding, probably. The cost is scary. But if you spend enough time thinking about it, considering the field, and introspecting about where you want your personal life to go, I think that\u2019s what it takes \u00a0 Nicole: When I first started at the company I\u2019m at now, they were just using Excel to do everything and used zero coding. So, I came in and they really relied on me to help innovate and change things. I started changing a lot of the processes from Excel over to Python and R but I was afraid that I was not doing things correctly because I was new to the field. I was scared I was kind of leading the company in the wrong direction or something. But I double, triple checked everything I did and made sure it\u2019s right. Now, we\u2019ve been growing and the company has more than doubled in size! Jesse: Finding a job afterward is very stressful and uncertain. Once you start working, you kind of go back to lots of learning and adjusting. Sometimes in my new team that I\u2019m on, I feel like there are moments I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing. But it\u2019s obvious to me that no one knows everything, and I can know things that more experienced or senior people might not know and that\u2019s okay. So no, I haven\u2019t experienced it that much. \u00a0 Nicole: I work at Guardian Premier Solutions. I think they found me through the Codeup Alumni Portal and contacted me. We interviewed for 30 minutes, and within one week they asked when I can start. We monitor psychological and physiological data through devices and tests to determine the best type of military training candidate. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve really been enjoying, and I really enjoy my coworkers as well. They really value input and new ideas, and I love that. Really grateful for this job, it\u2019s been really great. Thanks, Codeup!\u00a0 Jesse: Initially out of Codeup, I worked with a small boutique consulting firm, I was a contractor developing Excel macros. I was there short term and then got a job at USAA, also as a contractor. I was working on a team that was doing some design work and making presentations. Then, I transferred to a team that did data reporting, then to a team that did machine learning. I became a full-time employee and now get benefits. Honestly, everything\u2019s been great and I\u2019ve achieved everything I wanted to out of Codeup, which includes moving out of my mom\u2019s house! I\u2019m living a more stable life now. Overall, it\u2019s been really great.\u00a0 \u00a0 Hopefully, these stories serve as inspiration to not put yourself in a box simply based on your degree! The tech field is welcoming to anyone that can learn the skills, no matter their educational background. If you\u2019ve been wanting to pivot to a different field than what your degree is in, Codeup is the perfect place to start!

Likewise, employers get candidates with the relevant, foundational skills they need to help them reach business goals. How can we promise that? Employer partners regularly give us feedback on what\u2019s working at Codeup, what\u2019s not, and what they\u2019re looking for in a new hire. Read on to learn what it means to have an employer influenced curriculum. \u00a0 Employer partners are the companies that hire our graduates. They\u2019re the first to know about our recruitment events and we display their logo on our marketing materials. We also use their feedback to influence our curriculum, program offerings, and campus locations. When they\u2019re hiring, we learn what they\u2019re looking for and send a few handpicked candidates from a diverse pool of alumni. Every employer partner gets high quality, personalized matchmaking with no fees (it\u2019s completely free) and some even serve on our Technical Advisory Board. \u00a0 Annually, we host two Technical Advisory Board meetings with a few employer partners. One is to discuss Web Development and one is to discuss Data Science. In these meetings, the board gives feedback on their experiences with Codeup students to answer questions like: They also answer questions about Codeup more broadly, such as: Thirdly, they answer questions about their business, including: This kind of feedback is invaluable in both preparing our students for success and meeting employer expectations. As a result, we\u2019re very grateful for the participation of the Technical Advisory Board! \u00a0 In addition to the technical curriculum, students also receive a professional development curriculum. Led by our Professional Development Coordinator and Career Coaches, each student gets help with resume building, LinkedIn pages, and mock interviews.

We\u2019re launching a new scholarship to build and support the Black community in tech. The Annie Easley scholarship is a $1000 scholarship awarded to every Codeup student who identifies as Black or African-American. Read on to learn about our commitment to diversifying tech, our support of the Black community, and Annie Easley! \u00a0 We make an active, ongoing effort to cultivate inclusive growth at Codeup and in the tech field at large. By encouraging diversity in our cohorts, we are contributing to the long-term growth of underrepresented groups in tech when our students join the workforce. We offer need-based Pride, Veteran, Minorities in Tech, and Women in Tech scholarships. While the numbers of female, non-Black minority, and LGBTQIA+ developers are growing, they are still outpacing their Black counterparts. To help support the growth of the Black community in tech, our Annie Easley scholarship is a guaranteed $1,000 to every student who applies for the scholarship and identifies as Black and/or African-American. \u00a0 \u00a0 In 2018, only 2.7% of professional developers identified as Black. In two years, that number grew by less than 1%. In 2020, only 3.6% of professional developers identify as Black, even though the overall population is 13.4% Black. For some context, 70.7% of developers identify as white. Why do we care? The people building technology should represent the people using technology, and we need to do more to make that happen. Empowering underrepresented developers can increase career opportunities, normalize this career path for rising professionals, and yield more inclusive and equitable technology solutions. \u00a0 \u00a0 The centuries of racism and the ensuing, long-lasting burdens on the African-American population cannot be undone.\u00a0 We acknowledge that there are built-in hurdles that Black Americans have to overcome that are based on thoughts and ideals resulting from that racism. What we can do is work to level the playing field by softening the financial barrier to entry into tech. Our hope is that a guaranteed scholarship will help facilitate this and open up opportunities. \u00a0 Annie Easley was one of the first Black employees at NACA (now NASA), where she worked as a human-computer, computer engineer, and rocket scientist from 1955-1989. She wrote the code for the computer program that controls the fuel mixture of the Centaur rocket, which went on to successfully launch several space probes and is still being used today. Additionally, her work on energy conversion systems and alternative energy technology was used to develop the batteries used in modern hybrid vehicles. Easley has also co-authored several papers on nuclear power plants and rocket science. In 1977, she went back to school to get a degree in Mathematics while working full-time, where she raised awareness about NASA and inspired many women and minorities to pursue STEM careers. Later in her career, she helped supervisors address discrimination complaints as an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor, and fought for women\u2019s rights.\u00a0 Modern spaceflight likely wouldn\u2019t be possible without her, and much of what we know about space might still be unknown. Her work has been monumental not only for African-Americans, not only for women, not only for programmers, but for technology as we know it. That is why we\u2019re naming this scholarship and our next Data Science cohort after her. \u00a0 The technology of tomorrow starts today. If you identify as Black or African-American and would like to help build future technology, start a career as a software developer or data scientist!

We\u2019re pretty excited to celebrate World Mental Health Day, and think you should be, too! However you choose to celebrate, make sure it\u2019s something that relieves your stress and anxiety, not adds to it. (AKA, Don\u2019t read the book you hate or force yourself to do your least favorite workout.) Here are some recommendations from Codeup team members. \u00a0 Need counseling services? MDlive.com is the way to go!\u00a0 Going through a breakup? There\u2019s an app for that! Use the Mend app and letsmend.com! Too much going on in the world? Try staying off social media for the day.

We get questions like this all the time from prospective students. To make sure you\u2019re successful in your career transition, let\u2019s first set up some expectations about what you can expect before, during, and after Codeup. What is it like to experience life at a coding bootcamp? \u00a0 \u00a0 The number one, most important, most helpful advice we can give is: do the prework! Give yourself a month to carefully understand and complete the prework we assign when you\u2019re accepted, which was made to help you practice active learning and problem-solving. You\u2019ll soon find that programming is all about practice and getting that muscle memory, like learning to play an instrument. You will thank yourself if you finish it, and risk falling behind if you don\u2019t. In order to complete the prework, you\u2019ll need to apply early. Why? Take the start date you are considering, and subtract a month. You\u2019ll need to be accepted by that date in order to finish the prework. The multi-step application process can take several weeks to over a month. Combining the prework timeframe plus the application timeframe means you should apply seven weeks before your start date. This will also give you enough time to secure grant funding, if applicable, as that also takes about a month to be processed. You can learn more about our application process here.\u00a0 \u00a0 Codeup classes are full-time, immersive experiences. As a Codeup student, these are the times you will need to be in class: \u00a0 Classes are being conducted daily via live Zoom calls with instructors and other classmates. Optional office hours are held before and after class for additional help. You should plan to spend 20-25 additional hours per week practicing what you learned in class. You should also arrive at your workstation with coffee in tow 30 minutes before class starts so that you can map out your schedule for the day, and review what questions you have going into lecture. Combining office hours, planning, and practicing, you can expect to be occupied from 8am to 7 or 8pm almost daily. \u00a0 Now that you know your new schedule, you can probably see that you won\u2019t have time for much else. Just for a few months, you\u2019ll have to do the bare minimum outside of Codeup.\u00a0 You will need to quit your job. Before joining Codeup, try to save enough money to pay your bills for 6 months. We strongly suggest you avoid working outside of class, as this typically results in poor classroom performance, and we really want you to do well. If you have to work, calculate the bare minimum you need to earn each week in order to get by. Then, spread out your workload to do a little bit here and there throughout the week rather than full days on the weekends, because you do need rest days! The best options are flexible jobs where you\u2019re in charge of your own schedule, such as food delivery, rideshare, dog walking, babysitting, etc. This is not the time to take an overnight shift at your current job or start your own business. You may need to downgrade your living situation to save up. Some students have sold their houses to make this investment possible. Some have moved in with in-laws to save on bills. Some have had to find roommates. Do whatever you can, within reason, to not have to work during Codeup! You won\u2019t be able to adopt puppies, but you can get a fish, try raising plants, or look at pictures of puppies until you can get the real thing after you graduate! The last option is great because you\u2019ll have a reward to work towards, but you have to earn it! Outside classes are also a no-go, but you can watch YouTube videos and documentaries on a new subject you\u2019re interested in.\u00a0 Family and friends may not get to see you as much, but every weekend you can tell them all about what you\u2019re learning and appreciate the time together that much more! Remember, it\u2019s only 6 months of complete dedication to changing your life at a coding bootamp, and then you\u2019ll be thanking yourself for the sacrifices you made! Gone are the days of copying lecture notes word-for-word. (Did that ever work, anyway?) Since you\u2019ll have an online curriculum to read through and refer back to, write notes on what you don\u2019t understand during reading, practice, or lecture. It\u2019s good to track what exactly doesn\u2019t make sense and what you\u2019ve tried that didn\u2019t work so you can ask more targeted questions, whether to peers, Google, or instructors. This way, you\u2019re building yourself a roadmap to follow when you return to your studies each day. Learning how to code is like learning an instrument. Practice, practice, practice. You can do all the reading you want, watch all the video tutorials, and still not know how to code if you don\u2019t actually code. There\u2019s no cramming for exams, no writing research papers. It\u2019s continuous learning and adding to your arsenal through a few additional hours of study/practice every day. In order to make the most of your experience, build on skills, and help yourself for the job search in the long run, you\u2019ll be encouraged to attend meetups, join community Slack channels, and try to meet others in the industry to build your support network, so you have plenty of people to ask for help. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone! \u00a0 \u00a0 While this sounds totally foreign right now, it will become a daily mantra! Every Codeup student will make an account on a website called GitHub. On a daily basis, we\u2019ll expect you to \u201ccommit\u201d code, which means to make a revision to a code file, and then \u201cpush\u201d that revision, which, in this case, means to transfer it from your computer to GitHub so that others can keep track of how often you\u2019re coding. This is important to keep up after graduating Codeup to keep your coding skills fresh, and so that potential employers can see that you\u2019re actively working on your craft. Every day between graduation and the start of your job, you should become more valuable and skilled, not less polished and more rusty. The learning never stops, especially not in tech, and especially not in data science! What\u2019s all the rage one year may be out of date the next, and it\u2019s your responsibility to stay on top of the latest technology, programming languages, and practices. We have a whole team dedicated to helping students get jobs! Our placement team will assist you even after graduating. You\u2019ll spend time every day on either finding new listings, touching up your resume and LinkedIn, applying, or interviewing\u2026and that\u2019s in addition to coding every day. You gotta put in the work to find work. Do be prepared to get rejected sometimes, but trust the process. It\u2019s much better to face these mass unemployment rates with a whole team working to get you hired rather than on your own. In summary, you get out what you put in. Our most successful students finished their pre work and made significant life sacrifices to stay focused and committed to the program. Others that weren\u2019t ready, willing, or able to make the changes they needed were unfortunately not able to finish. However, those that do continue to reap the rewards! If you would like to hear more about life at a coding bootcamp like Codeup, don\u2019t hesitate to give us a call at 210 \u2013 802 \u2013 7289 to talk to a member of our admissions team today!"}, {"title": "What is Codeup\u2019s Application Process?", "content": "Curious about the application process? Wondering why you need to apply so far in advance? You\u2019ve come to the right blog post! From pre-work to technical assessments, to financial aid and interviews, there are a number of reasons you need to apply 1-2 months ahead of your start date. To explain Codeup\u2019s application process, let\u2019s start by working backward. \u00a0 Note: The tilde (squiggly) means \u201capproximately\u201d. \u00a0 After being accepted, every incoming student is given a set of pre-work to do to familiarize themselves with some coding basics. You won\u2019t be expected to have everything memorized, but some exposure will be required for you to hit the ground running on your first week of class. Many have likened our bootcamp to drinking out of a firehose- there\u2019s a lot of ground to cover in 5 months! Completing the pre-work is the best gift you can give yourself in order to soften the blow. Take the start date you are considering, and subtract a month. You should be accepted by that date in order to finish the prework.\u00a0 \u00a0 Once you\u2019re accepted, you\u2019ll meet with our Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager to discuss your financial aid options. She\u2019s also Codeup\u2019s School Certifying Official for VA Benefits, which take roughly 2 weeks to be processed. Scholarships are awarded about 2 weeks before the first class day, so you will need to have applied for any scholarships before then. Grants can range from 2-8 weeks to be processed and secured, but usually take about a month. You will need to be accepted before applying for grants. The tuition process is finalized in the month leading up to the start date, while you\u2019re also working on prework. \u00a0 Think of this as a casual job interview. We want to make sure you are culturally and behaviorally cut out for Codeup. The intensity and rigor is not for everyone. In this step of the application process, we\u2019re looking for motivated, positive, hard-working, and dedicated character traits. Bonus points if you read our blog post about tips for nailing a video interview!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For Web Development, we will give a couple of technical assessments to test your problem-solving skills. They are not necessarily pass/fail tests, but rather, they help us see how we can best prepare you for class. Those who do not do well on the first challenge have additional opportunities to develop their problem-solving skills. We want to be sure you are set up for success in class!\u00a0 For Data Science, the technical assessments may take much longer as there are more prerequisites, but it varies from person to person. We require a basic level of Python, math, and stats prior to being accepted. How well versed you are in those subjects determines how long this process takes. Could be a week if you were a math major in college, could be months if you\u2019ve never heard of Applied Statistics. Plenty of our students knew nothing about stats or Python before applying but worked through our recommended resources (tutorials and workshops) in order to get to the level they need to be on. Don\u2019t count yourself out! But do be realistic about how long it will take you to learn. If you were to apply for our Data Science program a couple weeks before class starts, knowing nothing about Python or stats, our Admissions Manager will be happy to provide all the necessary resources you need for a future start date, but you may not be qualified in time for the next class start, considering you\u2019d also have to finish pre-work in that limited time.\u00a0 For both programs, we have weekly study sessions with our Teaching Assistants to help you with any material that\u2019s causing you trouble! \u00a0 We may be virtual right now, but we\u2019re still doing virtual campus visits! You can think of this as a program overview. We\u2019ll discuss the admissions process, the curriculum, the schedule, how things are looking now that we\u2019re remote, and any questions you might have. \u00a0 You can think of this as an initial admissions consultation or phone interview, but really we\u2019re just making sure it\u2019s the right fit! Some people think applying for Codeup means getting paid to learn to code, some people think we teach medical coding. This call is just to introduce ourselves, make sure you\u2019re crystal clear on what Codeup is (a full-time career accelerator that trains and places data scientists and software developers), and to answer any questions you might have. \u00a0 The first step in your\u00a0application process is your application! It\u2019s basically just sending us your name and contact info so we can get the ball rolling on making you a Data Scientist or Software Developer! How exciting! Now, are you pumped to begin your own application process and experience all this in action? You can fill out your super quick application here. Our (helpful and friendly) Admissions team will be in touch ASAP to help you change careers. Even if you\u2019re not sure if Codeup is right for you, we can help you work through your doubts and hesitancies in your initial phone call.  \u00a0 With an Admissions Manager as your guide, our Teaching Assistants as your personal tutors, and our Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager as your tuition planning assistant, you\u2019ll never have to go at this alone! Apply now!"}, {"title": "What is the Transition into Data Science Like?", "content": "Alumni Katy Salts and Brandi Reger joined us at a public panel event to discuss their Transition into Data Science! Keep reading to hear what stands out to them about Codeup, how Codeup helped them launch a career in data science, and what they are up to now. Katy Salts graduated from Codeup\u2019s first Data Science cohort back in June of 2019. She has since started working as a Data Scientist at Cyber Fortress, where she has been for about a year. Prior to joining Codeup, Katy studied and worked in biology.\u00a0 Brandi Reger graduated from Codeup in July of 2020 with our third Data Science cohort. She has since been hired as a Data Engineer at HEB. Prior to joining Codeup, Brandi had just gotten a degree in Geology in pursuit of becoming an Archeologist after serving in the Army for 5 years. She minored in Statistics, which she wanted to pursue further after realizing archeology wasn\u2019t for her. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the ability to take off work and pursue a Masters Degree for 2 years or an undergrad degree for 4 years, and this was the perfect crash course. Also the cost is a lot cheaper than graduate programs and I got a lot of help with grants and scholarships.\u201d \u2013 Katy \u201cIt\u2019s very applied. You put what you learn into use and you learn why you learned it that way. In collegiate, you\u2019ll take a test but it\u2019s not quite the same thing as getting your hands dirty and figuring it out. Your mind can drift during lecture and you don\u2019t really \u201cget\u201d it until you do a project. But since you\u2019re doing a project on almost every topic at Codeup, that really solidified the topics we were learning for me.\u201d \u2013 Brandi \u201cI could not name one programming language. I didn\u2019t know anything. The prework was the first time I wrote a line of code. With Codeup, they will start you from the very beginning of learning programming, it\u2019s just fast-paced.\u201d \u2013 Katy \u201cJust get your hands dirty and do it! Once you\u2019re working on it, it turns out it\u2019s not as bad or as hard as you thought it was. Because you don\u2019t know it, it seems like this amazing, glorious thing in the sky but when you actually work on it you\u2019re like \u2018oh, it was just that, that\u2019s no big deal.\u2019 All you have to do is try and apply yourself and you\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d \u2013 Brandi \u201cThe first project we had, our instructor had to go away for the weekend so we couldn\u2019t contact her. The whole class collectively could not come up with an answer to the problem. We were freaking out thinking like \u2018We did something wrong. Why can we not figure it out? She left us!\u2019 We were so scared. When she came back she said \u2018you learned a really important lesson, and that\u2019s that sometimes there is no answer to the question. You just need to be able to look at the data and take it for what it is.\u2019 You can\u2019t make things up based on the data you find. You have to come up with real conclusions. That one hit me pretty hard and I never forgot it.\u201d \u2013 Katy \u201cThe prework is the best thing you can do for yourself coming into the program. We didn\u2019t go in knowing everything and memorizing it all, and they didn\u2019t expect us to either. You just have to know basic concepts. Like understand that there\u2019s a way to do something and maybe not necessarily know how yet but know that there\u2019s a way. So just being exposed to it ahead of time is helpful.\u201d \u2013 Katy \u201cI really liked being remote. Being in class, it was distracting. My classmates, we were best friends basically while we were going through the program. So we were constantly chatting and everything. But once it was remote it was all quiet. There was nobody distracting me, and I could focus on what I was doing.We could still chat when I wanted to but I could turn off chat when I needed to. Also when the teachers were talking, I had my dual monitors, so I was able to look up what they were talking about and it really solidified what I was learning. So, I got a lot out of it.\u201d \u2013 Brandi \u201cThey are not messing around! I mean, they start early and they leave no stone unturned! They come in and they\u2019re completely revamping your Linkedin, email, photos, what you should and should not post. One-on-one meetings about what you\u2019re looking for in a company and how they can help you get there, what connections they have, who to talk to, who to connect with. How to answer phone calls. Interview questions in class, like answering them together, answering them one-on-one. Mock interviews, resume building. Beginning to end, I mean, that alone was worth it to go through Codeup because no other place gives you that much attention on one single student, and everybody got that attention, and everybody got jobs! And that\u2019s because of all the work they put into getting you ready not just technically, but professionally. They will get you there if you just listen to them and don\u2019t fight back, don\u2019t argue. Just do what they\u2019re saying because they\u2019ve done this enough times and they know what works. Just trust them.\u201d \u2013 Katy \u201cMy job is awesome! I get to work from home. It\u2019s definitely constant learning. I think Codeup really prepared me for that because they didn\u2019t just teach me how to code- they taught me how to learn and how to learn quickly. I carried that into my job and my job taught me not only to code but also to be able to apply that to a business model. Learning doesn\u2019t stop after Codeup.\u201d \u2013 Katy \u201cI just started a couple of weeks ago so right now a day in the life is reading things and trying to figure out what they are. There are multiple data engineering teams so we all get together and talk about the projects we\u2019re working on and new projects coming down the line. Or we\u2019ll talk to the Data Scientists and they\u2019ll tell us how they\u2019re using our products and what they need from us, and we get to see what happens with the data we\u2019re cleaning and putting together. It\u2019s a constant moving forward and checking in with each other. At this job, you use every programming language you learn at Codeup and 10 others that I don\u2019t even know yet. Everything you learn is useful for something. Codeup teaching you how to learn is very useful because there are still a lot of things I need to learn now.\u201d \u2013 Brandi \u201cAs a Data Engineer, I clean up the data and put it together in a way that makes sense. We take the data in a nasty, messy state, it\u2019s all over the place, and make it nice and neat so that somebody else can figure something out from it.\u201d \u2013 Brandi \u00a0\u201cYou have to think of data science as a spectrum of things and on that spectrum you can specialize in different areas, like just gathering data, or just cleaning, just modeling, just making presentations or dashboards. A lot of businesses don\u2019t know what they actually need. They\u2019ll say they need one thing but really what they\u2019re asking for is something else. So you need to be able to sort through those and ask clear questions in interviews. That was a tough lesson to learn in the job search.\u201d -Katy \u00a0 More personal quotes include Katy saying that this was \u201cthe best thing I\u2019ve done\u201d and Brandi saying that the experience \u201cmade me a better person.\u201d Thank you both for joining us!

While many positions in data science work across the entire data science pipeline, some are more active in a particular area. Codeup prepares you to take any number of data science career paths throughout this pipeline. To help explain the differences, we\u2019ll discuss where some of our alumni have ended up. Keep reading to see what appeals to you! First up is the data portion of the data science pipeline, where we plan and acquire the data.\u00a0 Business Analysts like Jesse Ruiz and Jeff Hutchins, as well as People Analytics Specialists like Tim Sotirhos help their companies or departments identify what questions need to be answered, and what data they need to answer those questions. This often involves researching or reviewing existing processes and strategizing how they can be improved. They may work closely with project managers to create an action plan. Then, in the information portion, we process and prepare the data for future exploration. Data Analysts like Matthew Zapata aggregate and manage, that is, combine, process, prepare, and store, the data for easy access. They research and improve on data quality and safeguard against data loss or errors. They also explore the data for potential relationships between variables, usefulness, and outliers. Data Analysts may also acquire the data and/or analyze the data for potential insights, but typically do not build and deploy machine learning models. In the knowledge portion, data is analyzed and turned into meaningful statistics This stage is typically combined with Information or Intelligence rather than existing on its own. In a given company, their Data Analysts may both prepare and explore data, or the Machine Learning Engineers will both explore and model the data. Data Scientists, the broadest career in data science, typically will do all three, like Ednalyn De Dios. Unlike other data professionals (unless otherwise trained), Data Scientists can work anywhere along this continuum.\u00a0 Once we have that knowledge, we use the intelligence stage to turn it into future predictions with machine learning models. When the data is ready, Machine Learning Engineers like Michael Moran and Eric Escalante write the algorithms necessary to build, deploy, and continue to improve upon machine learning models. A machine learning model is a file that uses an algorithm to identify patterns and trends from data. Decision Science Analysts, like Jeff Roeder, use math, stats, and machine learning models to convert intelligence-driven insights to actionable recommendations. They answer the questions asked by Business Analysts earlier in the timeline to draw conclusions for their company. Finally, the action stage lets us integrate these insights into tests, then continue to monitor and evaluate new data. Security Data Analysts like Sara Pena need to be able to identify trends from automated models that they or someone else created. They meet with stakeholders to discuss their analysis and help develop tests and prototypes of their recommendations. They then own and execute projects related to continuous improvement of their company\u2019s processes. It\u2019s totally possible for YOU to take on any of these job titles! Maybe it\u2019s time to explore these careers even further, especially if one excited you.

Python is a programming language that can be used by software developers, accountants, mathematicians, and especially, data scientists. Python is actually the dominant programming language in data science, often used for data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Python is an object-oriented language, meaning that the focus is on data and procedures rather than functions and logic. By writing out procedures, you can actually modify the data you have. It can help you automate mundane, repetitive tasks, such as downloading websites, changing the format of those websites, renaming those files, and uploading them to servers. With Python, you can program all of these tasks to be done automatically every time you download a website. This automation saves data scientists a lot of time.\u00a0 Yes! One of the key features of Python is the short, easy to understand syntax in which you write your code. Its minimalistic nature allows you to focus on solving your problem rather than solving the code itself. It reads and feels more like English as compared to other common programming languages. Sometimes, what would take you 4 lines of code in Java can be done with 1 line of code in Python. Because it is a high-level language, meaning it is largely independent of your computer specifications, you can get started using Python on whatever device you have \u2013 even phones, tablets, or PlayStation! Python can be used for data wrangling, data analysis, data visualizations, and applying machine learning algorithms. Data wrangling involves preparing raw data for use by parsing it, meaning to convert each data point to a standard format, and by cleaning it, which means to separate useful data from erroneous or missing data points. This is relatively easy if you have only a few data points, but parsing Big Data by hand, like a thousands-of-terabytes large list of every transaction a retail store has ever had, is out of the question. So, Python is used to automate these tasks. It\u2019s also used for data analysis \u2013 helping you find trends, correlations, variations, and outliers; data visualizations \u2013 helping you chart or graph your findings to show to others; and machine learning, as the complex algorithms and workflows that it\u2019s capable of make it great for Artificial Intelligence. While this all sounds quite complex, remember, every data scientist started out knowing nothing about Python. Want to try it out?

Ever wonder how virtual personal assistants or dating apps work? Or how Netflix picks the perfect show for you? They\u2019re learning from you by optimizing and building upon human-created algorithms. Each text you type, person you swipe, or show you pick is stored as data, and through a process called machine learning, that data is plugged into algorithms to streamline your next texting, dating, or show-picking experience. Let\u2019s take any entertainment streaming service. It stores information about the titles you\u2019ve watched, like genre, actors, year, category, and how (if) you rated them, in order to recommend other titles you may also enjoy. It also considers what other titles members with similar preferences have enjoyed. All of this data is stored and used as input in algorithms, which are sets of rules that solve a problem. The problem, in this case, is that you might like to have a new show to watch. As you continue interacting with your entertainment streaming service, the better the recommendations will be, because the more data it has on what you choose to watch.\u00a0 Yes! Well, it\u2019s learning what humans tell it to learn. The same way we might read through a book given to us to study and memorize course material, the computer gathers and stores the data we tell it to store. However, we can choose to go beyond that book and learn from other sources by running an internet search or asking others. The machine lacks the intelligence to do this on its own, but if it was programmed to do so by a human, it could. Wikipedia defines machine learning as \u201cthe study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.\u201d The key word here is \u201cautomatically.\u201d A human manually sets up an algorithm that the machine uses to come to conclusions, but the more data the machine has, the more it has to \u201clearn\u201d from to improve its conclusions, without the need for a human programmer. However, the machine is only improving upon the algorithm, optimizing the output it gives with the more data it has, and not creating its own algorithms. Humans will always be needed to tell the machines what to do. If this sounds cool to you, have you ever considered a career in data science? There are a number of fascinating things to learn about data science and machine learning, and the best way to learn is with hands-on experience through numerous projects and fully-immersive learning.

If you\u2019re interested in becoming a Lead Software Developer for a government contractor, like Bryan, or having Misty\u2019s title of Data Management Analyst for a healthcare tech company, keep reading (and watching!) to see how they made that possible. Both panelists were established in their positions before finding Codeup. Misty had been an electrical engineer for 11 years, while Bryan worked in hospitality for 14 years. Both hungry for a change, Bryan found San Antonio before finding Codeup. While answering customer questions about why an application wasn\u2019t working the way it should, Bryan wanted to fix the problems, so he figured out a way to make that his job. Misty, however, first found data science before finding Codeup. Below, Misty discusses what stood out to her about Codeup. \u00a0 Both panelists knew exactly which program they wanted to apply for prior to even finding Codeup, but that isn\u2019t always the case. So, if you\u2019re torn, there are a number of things we\u2019ll help you think about. What are your interests? What is your background in? What are you expected to know before applying vs. before starting? What is your desired timeline? It will really help to talk this out with your admissions manager rather than on your own because you share a common goal, which is for you to succeed in the best program for you. \u00a0 The most important thing you\u2019ll learn at Codeup is how to learn. We can give you a solid foundation in skills like Python or Java, and you\u2019ll learn very quickly. But technology is always changing, and much more important than any singule particular skill is the ability to learn. Here, Bryan hits on how Codeup prepared him to learn new skills that they weren\u2019t explicitly taught in Codeup, but needed on the job. \u00a0 In addition to our curriculum, we also train you on professional development. In the midst of changing career paths so quickly, it can be easy to doubt yourself, or to not know the industry standards and expectations regarding the job search. To help you out, each student is coached professionally, in the ways that Bryan mentions here. \u00a0 In addition to professional development, we also offer job placement assistance. Not only will we help you develop the skills you need to land a job, but our Placement team goes above and beyond to actually make sure you get a job, and that by no means stops after you graduate. Misty didn\u2019t graduate with a job lined up, but still worked closely with the Placement team until she had one. \u00a0 The field of technology is always going to change. You\u2019ll always have to learn new things and you might start to feel like you can\u2019t do it. But Bryan says you just gotta push through. Misty has similar advice, below. Additionally, if you feel like tech is something you can\u2019t do, still apply for Codeup and as you move through the admissions process, allow us to work with you from where you\u2019re at in order to get you to where you need to be. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for! \u00a0 Be willing! Be willing to be vulnerable, willing to admit what you don\u2019t know, willing to work together, willing to ask for help when you need it. Instructors and admissions staff can\u2019t help you if we don\u2019t know that you need it. But so long as you seek out guidance, even if it means going outside of your comfort zone, we\u2019ll make sure you succeed! \u00a0 And that\u2019s how to build a career in tech! Desire the change, believe in your capacity to do it, follow through with a willingness to learn, and soon enough, you\u2019ll move from entry-level developer to Lead Developer, or from job seeker to helping a company build their first data science team.  Codeup is always ready and wanting to help along the way, it just starts with your application! \u00a0"}, {"title": "Codeup Grads Win CivTech Datathon", "content": "\u00a0 CivTechSA is a partnership between Geekdom, a coworking space that every current Codeup student\u00a0has complimentary access to, and San Antonio\u2019s Office of Innovation. In an effort to connect local communities, ideas, and data to help improve the City\u2019s services, the CivTech Datathon competition was born! Using public datasets, competitors look for missing data and areas for improvement and identify impactful solutions to current civic problems. Then, they present their insights to City of San Antonio departments like San Antonio Water System (SAWS) and Via Metropolitan Transit. Boasting first place was the Curie team We Came, We SAWS, We Conquered with Ryan McCall, David Wederstrandt Sr., Chase Thompson, Cameron Taylor, and Jeremy Cobb. They used data from SAWS regarding sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) events and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association to predict the root causes of SSO events. They generated a system that SAWS could use to prioritize maintenance of the sewers to limit the risk of these events, with the potential to save hundreds of millions of city dollars while keeping gastrointestinal health risks at bay. Taking second place was team Get on the Bus with Sean Oslin, Sara Pena, Fredrick Lambuth, Misty Garcia, Kevin Eliasen, and Faith Kane. With their project, they aim to increase ridership of public transportation. Using open data from VIA and the Census Bureau Data API, this team identified areas of improvement to make our community more diverse and equitable by making buses more accessible. As a special shoutout, at the 2019 CivTech Datathon, a team from our very first Data Science cohort competed and won the \u201cMost Solvable\u201d award. The team members were Ednalyn C. De Dios, Joseph Burton, and Sandra Graham. Their project was similar to our Curie team \u2013 they trained a model to predict which pipes would overflow. If you\u2019re passionate about improving civic issues and want to present your findings to city stakeholders too someday, Codeup can teach you how! You might actually inspire lasting change (or at least get thousands of dollars in prize money)! If these Codeup students could win first and second place at the datathon, what\u2019s stopping you? Click here to learn more about our Data Science program. Then, we\u2019ll see you at next year\u2019s CivTech Datathon!"}, {"title": "How Codeup Alumni are Helping to Make Water", "content": "Imagine having a kit mailed to you with all the necessary components to make contaminated water clean. Cool, huh? Four of our alumni are helping to make that possible by partnering with the non-profit Elequa to design a website for their Make Water program. With this project, these Codeup alumni have the potential to make a global impact: Jacqueline Murralles, James Murralles, Ted Zamarron, and Carlos Teller.\u00a0 The Make Water program inspires, educates, and equips people that want to make a tangible difference in the world. Elequa puts together DIY kits with the tools to purify water and delivers them to people that need them, locally and abroad. This project is also given to students in the San Antonio area, who in turn are challenged to research, tweak, and further develop the kits to make them better and more accessible. These problem-solving challenges engage students in the STEM field, inspiring teamwork and collaboration while making a difference that they can be proud of: helping to provide clean water. Currently, the Make Water program lacks a platform to house and share the data gathered by students to improve the kits, while also challenging other community members for further development. They needed help with the gamification of these processes to make participation more engaging. That\u2019s where Codeup alumni Jacqueline Murralles, James Murralles, Ted Zamarron, and Carlos Teller came in. They are helping Elequa to build an open-source application for the Make Water program that turns community participation into a game where users can level up as they contribute and collaborate through an array of real-world challenges in water research, coding, hardware innovation, and creative storytelling. Did we mention that they are working on this project as volunteers, as Codeup alumni often do? Codeup students are always looking for ways to challenge themselves, sharpen their skills, and make a difference, and that continues after graduation. To see more of the projects our students have worked on (and what you can do, too, with Codeup), check out these capstone presentations."}, {"title": "Alumni Share their Journey into Web Development", "content": "Everyone starts somewhere. Many developers out there didn\u2019t grow up wanting to code. It\u2019s something they fell into over time, much like two Codeup alumni, Bridget Mills and Eddy Bautista. These two software developers graduated from our Web Development class in December 2019. They came back for a virtual panel event to share their journey into web development and to give advice to people wanting to become a software developer. \u00a0 Eddy had been a sales assistant for years and was a student at San Antonio College studying Kinesiology. Bridget worked at a courthouse, but those career plans were altered after becoming a military spouse and moving. She went back to school for a degree in Information Technology (IT), specializing in System Engineering, and became an IT Specialist. \u00a0 When someone he knew mentioned coding, Eddy learned all he could and coded for three days using online courses and tutorials. He immediately knew this was what he wanted to do as a career.\u00a0 While Bridget was working at the lawyer\u2019s office, a development team came in to help with court systems. She asked them questions and became fascinated by what they were doing. After deciding not to pursue law, she decided to go back to school for IT. Her job as an IT Specialist isn\u2019t exactly what she had in mind, but her degree didn\u2019t offer the coding experience necessary to become a developer, which was her true end goal. Even after moving to Hawaii and having two kids, that dream persisted. Her cousin, a developer, mentioned that some of her coworkers went to a coding bootcamp. With another kid and another move on the horizon, she decided she would enroll in a coding bootcamp when her family settled down in Texas.\u00a0 \u00a0 While researching how to become a developer, Eddy found Codeup. Our culture stood out to him, the admissions team was helpful, he liked that we offer help with the job search through resume assistance and interview training, and he really liked how plugged in we are to the San Antonio technology scene. He felt all the pieces coming together and could picture himself here. For Bridget, it boiled down to the curriculum and hands-on experience. When she was in college, she learned a lot of theory, but didn\u2019t get experience actually coding, which, as she learned the hard way, is what employers are really looking for. She looked into some options for coding bootcamps and Codeup stood out to her. It was big plus that even as a military spouse, she was able to use VA benefits. She loved our assistance with job placement, and noted that she had gone to school twice and neither college offered anything like that.\u00a0 \u00a0 Currently, both panelists are working as developers for VIA Metropolitan Transit. Due to COVID-19, they\u2019re both working from home. Eddy usually starts his day early with a coding challenge on a website like Codewars. He has a virtual meeting with his mentor to discuss some code. For most of the day, they solve a problem or do some pair programming. They also have team meetings and daily standups. Bridget is currently leading an Artificial Intelligence project with VIA that takes up most of her time. She usually has virtual meetings with members of her team, other teams at VIA, and contractors. She does documentation and uses programs to update the current status of her projects for the team to see.\u00a0 \u00a0 Coding is a hobby for Bridget. She takes her laptop with her from room to room, sometimes coding with her child in her lap. She loves it so much, she often works late unintentionally until her kids come in the room to check on her. Because of this, she doesn\u2019t feel completely balanced but knows that it\u2019s only because she loves it so much. Eddy feels similarly, stating that when they do work late, it\u2019s usually because they want to. The work-life balance has been good for him. \u00a0 Bridget was nervous coming into Codeup, but it gave her everything she was looking for. Part of why she wanted to begin her journey into web development was because she thought developers get to sit around alone, not having to interact with anybody. She very quickly realized this was not the case. \u201cYou have to speak up and you have to do it well, and often, with a lot of people. You\u2019ll have to work hard, beyond the regular hours. Take advantage of all the resources. Schedule some meetups with peers to work together outside of class. It\u2019s so worth it in the end. Just go for it!\u201d Eddy learned that keeping a part-time job is possible but really, really hard. He was one of the only students ever to finish Codeup while working a job, rushing to work right after class. He regrets doing that because he missed out on socializing and working together after hours. But when he had time, he always tried to work with other students to solve problems together, and encourages the same in others. \u201cBreak out of your comfort zone and don\u2019t be scared to just start from where you are. The first couple weeks will be really hard, but learn to fall in love with the feeling of being stuck, because eventually you\u2019ll be able to solve it.\u201d Bridget and Eddy are working together at VIA, but took very different pathways to get to where they are. Eddy hadn\u2019t thought much about coding before deciding to dive right into it, whereas Bridget wanted a career as a developer for years. Whether coding is something you never gave much thought to or you\u2019ve tried a different route before, you, too, can make a transition into web development with Codeup! If you\u2019re interested in starting a career that you love in an ever-growing industry, apply today!\u00a0"}, {"title": "How to Succeed in a Coding Bootcamp", "content": "We held a virtual event called \u201cHow to Succeed in a Coding Bootcamp\u201d featuring our Dallas-based Full-Stack Web Development instructors, Douglas Hirsh and Fernando Mendoza. To start our incoming students off on the right foot, we wanted to hear what advice they have to optimize a coding bootcamp experience. Check out their top tips below! \u201cPractical information and practical skills are going to be acquired by practicing every single day.\u201d \u2013 Fernando Practice is an essential part of learning something new. You could watch people bake all day long, and still not be any better of a baker yourself. That\u2019s why our students spend more time actually writing code than listening to lectures. You\u2019ll practice alone, with your cohort, and with instructor guidance. Through this practice, you will change the way you think and approach problems. The instructors agreed that practicing on your own through fun side projects, like creating a program to organize your baking recipes, sets the most successful students apart from the rest. \u00a0 \u201cThe reason Codeup is every weekday from 9-5 is because we need you to be fully invested. If you only coded on weekends or in your free time, you would forget everything you saw last time and wouldn\u2019t be able to build upon what you know.\u201d \u2013 Fernando Don\u2019t just practice. Practice consistently. Many of our students have tried the self-taught route and eventually ended up at Codeup. Why? Practicing every now and then doesn\u2019t cut it when it comes to something as complex as programming, the same way practicing every now and then isn\u2019t how you learn a language or an instrument. The way to succeed at something is by practicing it frequently and consistently. It\u2019s no different for how to succeed in a coding bootcamp. Codeup is fully immersive for that very purpose. \u00a0 \u201cThe best thing you can do is the prework that we assign.\u201d \u2013 Douglas Help your future self by doing the prework assigned before the first day of class.. This isn\u2019t just busy work. It\u2019s for you and only you. We won\u2019t take a grade on it, it\u2019s really, entirely, to set yourself up for success. We will move incredibly fast and it will feel like drinking from a firehose, even if you did do the prework. Do future you a big favor by getting used to what drinking from a firehose feels like! \u00a0 \u201cReplace frustration with curiosity, then experimentation.\u201d \u2013 Fernando As you consistently practice the prework, you will come across errors. Instead of getting frustrated, let the errors trigger your curiosity of \u201cwhy isn\u2019t that working?\u201d and \u201chow do I get it to work?\u201d You can google the keywords in the error message and figure out what to do. This gives you practice problem solving on your own instead of immediately asking someone else for help. While we love helping our students, we will expect you to have already tried to figure things out because we believe in your ability to problem solve. When you do need help, this process helps you frame your questions. We won\u2019t give you answers, but we will happily point to a different way of thinking about an error. It will make getting it right that much more satisfying. \u00a0 \u201cWe want you to be in the mindset of understanding and not discovery. The prework is what takes you there.\u201d- Fernando Problem solving your way through the prework allows you to be an active participant in your own learning. You\u2019re giving yourself exposure to a topic before class so that during the lecture, you\u2019re not discovering something new, but trying to understand it. You might not get it the first time you see it, but now you know what to look out for in the lecture. \u00a0 \u201cThink about where you were 5 weeks ago. Use evidence over time that things have gotten better rather than dwelling on failure in the moment. Failure is learning. Failure is good.\u201d \u2013 Douglas As you progress through the program, you will face obstacles and failures, and you will doubt yourself as a programmer. When you feel like you can\u2019t do something, compare yourself to who you were and what you could do 5 weeks ago, instead of comparing yourself to \u201creal programmers.\u201d After reminding yourself of your progress, think about what obstacles are keeping you from moving forward and how to overcome them, instead of defaulting to \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Kevin Kelley once said, \u201cPros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.\u201d \u201cWe have you do group projects and paired programming projects and you get a lot of really good experience working with people remotely. It\u2019s a really good skill to have.\u201d \u2013 Douglas Programmers are not in a room alone all day with 10 screens in front of them. They are frequently communicating with their team, with different teams, and with different clients. You\u2019ll need to know how to storytell and how to present your work and yourself. Throughout the course, you will frequently be working with others and presenting to others. Now that we\u2019ve gone remote, our students are learning to work together from far apart. \u00a0 How successful you are in a coding bootcamp starts with you and how much you\u2019re willing to put in. If you\u2019re ready to continue putting in time and effort, check out our events. Our workshops will give you exposure to code, and our panels will let you hear the perspectives of people who made the same career change you\u2019re hoping for. You got this! Together, we\u2019ll help you not only succeed in a coding bootcamp, but in your career."}, {"title": "From Slacker to Data Scientist: Journey to Data Science Without a Degree", "content": "Butterflies in my belly; my stomach is tied up in knots. I know I\u2019m taking a risk by sharing my story, but I wanted to reach out to others aspiring to be a data scientist. I am writing this with hopes that my story will encourage and motivate you.\u00a0 ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I don\u2019t have a PhD. Heck, I don\u2019t have any degree. Still, I am very fortunate to work as a data scientist in a ridiculously good company. Here\u2019s how I did it (with a lot of help). \u00a0 It was 1995 and I had just gotten my very first computer. It was a 1982 Apple IIe. It didn\u2019t come with any software but it came with a manual. That\u2019s how I learned my very first computer language: Apple BASIC. My love for programming was born. In Algebra class, I remember learning about the quadratic equation. I had a cheap graphic calculator then, a Casio, that\u2019s about half the price of a TI-82. It came with a manual too, so I decided to write a program that will solve the quadratic equation for me without much hassle. My love for solving problems was born. In my senior year, my parents didn\u2019t know anything about financial aid but I was determined to go to college so I decided to join the Navy so that I could use Montgomery GI Bill to pay for my college. After all, four years of service didn\u2019t seem that long. My love for adventure was born. Later in my career in the Navy, I was promoted as the ship\u2019s financial manager. I was in charge of managing multiple budgets. The experience taught me bookkeeping. My love for numbers was born. After the Navy, I ended up volunteering for a non-profit. They eventually recruited me to start a domestic violence crisis program from scratch. I had no social work experience but I agreed anyway. My love for saying \u201cWhy not?\u201d was born. \u00a0 After a few successful years, my boss retired and the new boss fired me. I was devastated. I fell into a deep state of clinical depression and I felt worthless. I recall crying very loudly at the kitchen table. It had been more than a year since my non-profit job and I was nowhere near close to having a prospect for the next one. I was in a very dark space. Thankfully, the crying fit was a cathartic experience. It gave me a jolt to do some introspection, stop whining, and come up with a plan. \u201cChoose a Job You Love, and You Will Never Have To Work a Day in Your Life.\u201d \u2014 Anonymous \u00a0 To pay the bills, I was working as a freelance web designer/developer but I wasn\u2019t happy. Frankly, the business of doing web design bored me. It was frustrating working with clients who think and act like they\u2019re the expert on design. So I started thinking, \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d Searching the web, I stumbled upon the latest news in artificial intelligence. It led me to machine learning which in turn led me to the subject of data science. I signed up for Andrew Ng\u2019s machine learning course on Coursera. I listened to TwitML, Linear Digression, and a few other podcasts. I revisited Python and got reacquainted with git on Github. My love for data science was born. It was at this time that I made the conscious decision to be a data scientist. \u00a0 Learning something new was fun for me. But still, I had that voice in my head telling me that no matter how much I study and learn, I will never get a job in data science without a degree. So, I took a hard look in the mirror and acknowledged that I needed help. But I wasn\u2019t sure where to look. Then one day out of the blue, my girlfriend asked me what data science is. I jumped off my feet and started explaining right away. Once I stopped explaining to catch a breath, I managed to ask her why she asked. And that\u2019s when she told me that she\u2019d seen a sign on a billboard. We went for a drive and I saw the sign for myself. It was a curious billboard with two big words \u201cdata science\u201d and a smaller one that says \u201cCodeup.\u201d I went to their website and researched their employment outcomes. I was sold. \u00a0 Before the start of the class, we were given a list of materials to go over. Given that I had only about two months to prepare, I was not expected to finish the courses. But, I did them anyway. I spent day and night going over the courses and materials, did the tests, and got the certificates! I knew then that I could get into data science without a degree. \u00a0 Codeup was a blur. We had a saying in the Navy about the bootcamp experience: \u201cthe days drag on but the weeks fly by.\u201d This was definitely true for the Codeup bootcamp as well. We were coding in Python, querying the SQL database, and making dashboards in Tableau. We did projects after projects. We learned about different methodologies like regression, classification, clustering, time-series, anomaly detection, natural language processing, and distributed machine learning. More important than the specific tools, I learned:\u00a0 \u00a0 Our job hunting process started from day one. We updated our LinkedIn profile and made sure that we were pushing to Github almost every day. I even spruced up my personal website to include the projects we did during class. And of course, we made sure that our resum\u00e9 was in good shape. Codeup helped me with all of these. In addition, Codeup also helped prepare me for both technical and behavioral interviews. The student placement team taught me how to optimize answers to highlight my strengths as a high-potential candidate. \u00a0 My education continued even after graduation. In between filling out applications, I wrote code every day and tried out different Python libraries. I regularly read the news for the latest developments in machine learning. While doing chores, I would listen to a podcast, a TedTalk, or a LinkedIn learning video. When bored, I listened to or read books about data or professional development. I\u2019ve had a lot of rejections. The first one was the hardest but after that, it kept getting easier. I developed a thick skin and learned to keep moving. \u00a0 It took me 3 months after graduating from Codeup to get a job. When I got the job offer, I felt very grateful, relieved, and excited. I could not have done it without Codeup and my family\u2019s support. It is possible to start a career in data science without a degree! ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This blog post was written by Ednalyn C.

The audience met three of our current students: Jada Shipp, formerly a Newborn Hearing Specialist, Daniel Guerrero, who was a Vaccine Product Manager, and Ryan McCall, who was an overnight Surveillance Agent at Walmart. They discussed what led them to this career path, how their Data Science bootcamp experience has been so far, and what they plan to do after Codeup. Read on to learn about the Codeup Data Science bootcamp experience and their key takeaways and advice! \u00a0 The students began by discussing their \u201cwhys\u201d and \u201chows\u201d of pursuing data science at Codeup. Jada: I was going to apply to medical school but decided it wasn\u2019t for me. A friend suggested Codeup, which is how I learned about data science. I realized it\u2019s something I was already interested in. I was really big on solving all my problems in school on Excel and coming up with the best graphs and digging around in numbers. I just didn\u2019t know there was a name for this, and certainly didn\u2019t know it was a career path. Daniel: At a new job as a Vaccine Product Manager, they started asking me to do research about where we\u2019re selling our product and who\u2019s buying. I quickly discovered this was a massive, billion dollar company and there was no one there that actually knew how to use Excel or how to look at sales. It was mind blowing to me because I thought this was standard and everyone was doing it. Then I realized my company is not the only one that has this gap. Ryan: I went to college for chemistry, then started working security but wasn\u2019t satisfied with it. I wanted to use my brain more to think and actively solve problems at my job. So, I started looking at programming as a job career. I found data science and absolutely fell in love with it and spent two years trying to teach it to myself on the side of my security job. It was very hard, I spent most of that time figuring out what resources to trust. It\u2019s a lot easier being taught than searching in the dark. \u00a0 Lots of us know how it feels to come out of a full semester of class feeling like we didn\u2019t absorb anything and not knowing how it applies to real life. Not here. Jada: I thought getting admitted was a mistake and they\u2019d kick me out at any time. I had zero coding experience and I really didn\u2019t think I could do it. But I went step by step. \u2018Maybe I can\u2019t do this but I can probably do this one tiny part of it.\u2019 They\u2019ll explain it in as many different ways as they need to until your lightbulb goes on.\u00a0 Daniel: They\u2019ll give you questions that force you to think. They won\u2019t just give you an answer. You have to figure it out yourself but they give you the tools to be able to do that. And because of the collaborative environment, we\u2019re learning from each other as a cohort and not just instructors. Now, I\u2019m able to branch out into new territories and not be scared to do so because I\u2019m well equipped. Ryan: I\u2019m honestly amazed by what we can do in such a short amount of time. I can do things that I thought it would take me years to do. \u00a0 In such an immersive, fast-paced environment, it was a joy to hear how much our students have loved their experience so far. Jada: Everything we do every week, I\u2019m like \u201cThis is so cool! Last week was nothing!\u201d Daniel: Every week I have the same conversation with my parents about the program. \u201cWhat are you doing this week?\u201d \u201cOh it\u2019s my favorite thing!\u201d \u201cYou say that every week!\u201d But other than everything, the projects are the coolest thing for me. Ryan: We could talk about this for hours, we love this stuff! Aside from loving the material, you become like a little family. We\u2019ve had all the same bad experiences, all the same good experiences. You\u2019re speaking a similar language and you can figure it out together. \u00a0 In between lessons, students work closely with our placement team, where we help students land awesome jobs. Jada: I want to use data in health care. I have a degree in Public Health and worked as an EMT, a scribe, and a hearing screener. Now, I want to merge my passion for public health with data science skills. I\u2019m pretty confident I can get a job like this because the Codeup placement team helps you through every step\u2013 resume, Linkedin, interview skills. They are not gonna let you fall by the wayside. They remember you and who you are and what you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s not a generic cookie cutter process where you get what you get. They know you and it\u2019s customized for you. Daniel: I told the placement team that I want to work with data that\u2019s business to customer. Two days later they sent me applications and they\u2019re actually what I asked for, in industries I actually told them about, with companies I actually mentioned. I was mind blown! The placement team will open as many doors as they possibly can to get you the right opportunity, I am more than impressed with the placement team. Ryan: I want to be a data scientist and I don\u2019t know what kind of data scientist, I just want to be one! And they can work with that, too! \u00a0 All three panelists said the same thing: DO THE PREWORK!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We want to thank Jada, Daniel, and Ryan for sharing their passion with us and acting as mentors for prospective and current students for the night. They are each blossoming into data scientists that couldn\u2019t hide how much they love what they do even if they tried. Do you want a similar transition? Start your own Data Science bootcamp experience today by learning more. Scared it\u2019s too risky and you won\u2019t get a job? That\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll refund your tuition if you don\u2019t. Any more excuses? There won\u2019t be once you give us a call. "}, {"title": "From Bootcamp to Bootcamp: Two Military Veterans Discuss Their Transition Into Tech", "content": "Are you a veteran or active-duty military member considering your next steps? Our alumni have been in your boots. In a recent virtual panel, two military veterans in tech discussed their transition into the field with Codeup: Benny Fields III, a retired Air Force Master Sergeant turned Full Stack Web Developer, and Jeffery Roeder, a Navy Intelligence Analyst turned Data Scientist. Whether you\u2019re interested in Data Science or Web Development, here are some key takeaways from the event.\u00a0 \u201cThe GI Bill was a huge plus, but the icing on the cake was the placement program.\u201d \u2013 Benny Fields After retiring from the Air Force, Benny Fields took a job as a technical writer, but he quickly became more interested in the software he was writing about than the writing itself. His friend suggested looking into a coding bootcamp, which he did. He liked that Codeup accepts the GI Bill to help military veterans in tech, and the icing on the cake for him was learning about the work our student placement team does to get you hired. \u201cThey\u2019ll give you every imaginable tool to get placed. They have tons of connections- it\u2019s crazy. Colleges aren\u2019t gonna do that for you.\u201d \u2013 Jeff Roeder We\u2019ll buff up your resume, set up mock interviews, and give you the know-how to nail your interviews and get a job offer. From how to dress, to what to say in a thank you letter, Jeff said it best: we\u2019ll give you every imaginable tool to get placed in a new career. And it\u2019s backed up by our tuition refund.\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThey basically tailored their workshop to me. That\u2019s the kinda stuff that Codeup\u2019s gonna do, they\u2019ll get you there!\u201d \u2013 Jeff Roeder Jeff Roeder heard about Data Science classes at Codeup from a friend who had seen our \u201ccrazy billboards\u201d (one of which features Benny). He\u2019s a former intelligence analyst, but the admissions process wasn\u2019t entirely a breeze for him. After studying and studying, Python just wasn\u2019t clicking, and he failed one of his technical assessments. He was about to give up on it, but our admissions team wasn\u2019t ready to give up on him. We personally invited him to one of our Saturday workshops where we taught him step by step how to build the foundation he needed.\u00a0 \u201cThey were like \u2018hey, you\u2019re gonna learn Spanish and you only have six months to do it,\u2019 which is much like going to Codeup to learn something new, you only have six months to do it.\u201d \u2013 Jeff Roeder When Jeff first joined the Navy as a linguist, he was told to learn Spanish in six months. When he joined Codeup, he was told to learn Data Science in five months. They were both immersive experiences where people of different personalities and different cultures joined together for a common goal. As Jeff put it, you may not always like someone or relate to them, but you need each other to accomplish what needs to get done. \u201cComing to Codeup, I had to be flexible because I had to learn to adapt to new technologies with new people that were way younger than me and were catching on faster.\u201d \u2013 Benny Fields For Benny, one similarity is that in the Air Force, you have to be flexible. He was used to having a planned day and changing it at the drop of a hat. In the tech field, things are always changing, and flexibility and constant learning are essential. This is where the military flexibility really came in handy for him. Jeff and Benny may have completed different Codeup programs but they both had the same journey from bootcamp to bootcamp. Both failed their technical assessments at first and had to leverage our resources to get through the admissions process. They both worked with our financial aid team to use their VA benefits for the course, and they both left Codeup with a job and a new skillset. Both are now successful military veterans in tech! \u00a0 If you\u2019re looking for your next step and want to learn more about using VA benefits to attend Codeup, talk with our team today!

Whether you\u2019re just beginning to learn or you\u2019ve been programming for years, you\u2019re going to run into roadblocks and get stuck. Our Data Science Instructor, Ryan Orsinger, has seen 36 cohorts of students come through Codeup and helped build their problem-solving skills through live, audience-centered lectures. Check out his recipe for success below: You\u2019re learning to code, learning the syntax for a programming language, and working on thinking programmatically. The lesson or lecture is completed and now you\u2019re now facing a programming problem that is expecting you to understand and apply the new content. \u00a0 1. With intent, read the curriculum and the code examples. 2. Go back and deliberately read the example code very closely and slowly. 3. Copy any example code into your editor. 4. Run the example code 5. Observe results. Think about each piece of code. What is it doing, what did you expect it to do? 6. Try modifying the example code so that you change variables to see different results (one at a time\u2026) If the example code demonstrates how to make a loop from 0 to 9:\n\u2013 Modify the code to make a loop that starts at 1 and ends at 10.\n\u2013 Modify the code to make a loop that starts at 10 and counts down to 0. 7. Try removing as many moving pieces from the code for the new concept as possible\u2026 try to isolate a unit of work that uses the new concept and test it in isolation 8. Read the first exercise problem. Read it slowly, with attention to detail. 9. Ask yourself questions about the exercise: 10. Work to write code for a smaller problem than the exercise asks.\nIf the exercise says:\n\u2013 Prompt the user for a number between 1 and 50\n\u2013 If the input is not numeric or out of that range, ask them again for a number. Repeat until they give a number between 1 and 50.\n\u2013 Start by making sure you\u2019re able to prompt a user, then store the result of prompt to a variable for later.\n\u2013 Go after the low-hanging fruit first. Momentum begets momentum. 11. If you\u2019re still having problems and stuck, go to step 1. 12. If friction, confusion, and \u201cwriter\u2019s block\u201d persist, then ask for help from another human being. Explain the steps you\u2019ve already taken, and attempt to ask your question as clearly as possible. Here\u2019s a good resource on how to ask effective questions! Ryan Orsinger is a proud instructor here at Codeup. Check out his personal blog for more insightful information here! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you were inspired by this article and have any questions about our programs, give us a call.\u00a0We\u2019d love to chat."}, {"title": "The Best Path to a Career in Data Science", "content": "\u201cBut don\u2019t I need a degree to get a job as a data scientist?\u201d As a non-traditional educational model, we hear this concern a lot. The answer is yes and no. Yes, because most jobs in data science require some form of higher education. No, because that degree doesn\u2019t have to be in something related to data science \u2013 data scientists have degrees in many different areas of study! So if the concern that lacking a piece of paper will prevent you from accelerating your career, fear no more. While a Master\u2019s Degree provides a lot of value, it isn\u2019t the most direct path for a job. With the exponential growth in data generation and the race to keep up with storing and processing that data, data science no longer sits at the fringe of an ultra-specialized workforce. Companies now need much larger teams to analyze, model, and leverage the data they\u2019ve collected. So while the field of data science might have once only been available to those skilled in highly academic algorithm development, it\u2019s now a playground for those with some Python skills who know how to find valuable insights in a mess of data.\u00a0 \u00a0 Now let\u2019s get a bit more specific. If modern roles in data science demand more practical skills, why is a bootcamp a better path? \u00a0 #1: Responsive curriculum: Barely 10 years ago nobody had heard of data science. But in that short amount of time, the tools and technologies in the field have grown exponentially. Each year sees the introduction of new packages, visualization tools, and cutting edge technologies. With such a rapidly evolving landscape, it\u2019s hard for traditional learning environments to keep pace. With our ears tuned directly to employers, we\u2019re able to adapt quickly and ensure we\u2019re teaching what hiring managers need. \u00a0 #2 Hands-on Project-Based Learning: Have you ever watched Top Chef or The Great British Bake Off? You were probably pretty entertained, but how did that seared Ahi Tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduced amuse-bouche turn out? The sad reality is, watching experts do their thing doesn\u2019t make you an expert. Nor does listening to lectures. Our program is built around the concept of praxis, which is essentially the practical application of theory, or the blending of theory and practice. Half of your 670 program hours are spent actually writing code, so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming. A career in data science is like an old-time trade, like becoming a blacksmith: you have to learn from masters and practice, practice, practice.\u00a0 \u00a0 #3 Progressive Curriculum Structure: In a traditional degree, students study by taking several classes at a time. You may begin with data structures and algorithms, then move to SQL, then take Python, and so on. But real-world data science doesn\u2019t work so neatly. You will never face a project where you\u2019re only working with one of those tools, so this pedagogical method is misaligned with career demands. Our program focuses on real-world deliverables at every step of the journey, while exposing you to increasingly complex problems and projects. You start off applying basic tools to simple challenges. Then, we begin varying the data sets, the way you access that data, the type of methodology you use, and the deliverable you\u2019re responsible for. To put it simply, the structure of a traditional degree teaches you how to use a hammer, a saw, and a chisel. Codeup teaches you how to build a stool, a birdbox, and a sculpture with those tools, and when to use which.\u00a0 \u00a0 #4 Job Placement Services: If education is your goal, stop reading now. If a career is your goal, then you\u2019re in the right place. Most graduate institutions have career service offices where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fairs. But Codeup makes you a promise: get a job after graduation or get 100% of your money back. There are no two ways about that: our singular focus is your outcome. Unlike traditional institutions, we sell jobs, not education.\u00a0 \u00a0 #5 Messy Data: This is probably the most important difference between us and traditional degrees. We use real, messy, misleading, broken data so you learn how to draw insights from the real thing. Unfortunately, that is not the norm. Because of the segmented class structure, traditional degrees have to focus on using data that teach one specific skill. At Codeup, you\u2019re always applying your tools to a real deliverable, so we\u2019re able to use real data sets that intersect the challenges of multiple skills.\u00a0 \u00a0 Lastly, we encourage you to think about the return on your investment in your education. *read more on our outcomes \u00a0 Most importantly, the opportunity cost of pursuing a master\u2019s degree is equal to 13-19 months of employment. At a median salary of $67,500 from Codeup, that\u2019s between $67,500-$101,250 in foregone earnings.\u00a0 So, you want a career in data science? A career accelerator like Codeup is the path for you. Still not convinced? We\u2019re here to hear your concerns \u2013 contact us and let\u2019s talk it through."}, {"title": "Getting Hired in a Remote Environment", "content": "As a career accelerator with a tuition refund guarantee, we have always been focused on employment outcomes for our students. Going remote hasn\u2019t changed that! Two months into this remote world, we thought we\u2019d pause today to explain how we prioritize your success and ensure you get hired. \u00a0 First of all, our career placement services are built on one-on-one relationships. Our Placement team works with students individually to develop a professional portfolio, define a strategy, and conduct a job search. They\u2019ll help perfect your resume, conduct individual career coaching, and prepare you with mock interviews. And they don\u2019t let off until you\u2019ve signed that offer letter! Since we\u2019ve gone remote, our placement team has digitized their curriculum so it\u2019s accessible to all our students, and they\u2019ve continued working one-on-one over Zoom.\u00a0 \u00a0 Those one-on-one relationships aren\u2019t exclusive to students. It\u2019s the same approach our team takes with their network of hiring managers and recruiters. From curriculum advisory panels to guest speaker lunchtime talks, we involve employers as often as we can. We forge a personal relationship that encourages repeat hiring, open communication, and trust. \u00a0 Lastly, your job search kicks off with a bang in our staple Developer Days and Data Scientist Days. Normally, these are in-person demonstrations of capstone projects that end in a reverse job fair with employers. On April 16th, we hosted our first-ever virtual Developer Day. Over 160 people tuned into it live! Not only did we maintain the quality of the event, but we increased attendance and visibility. That event, especially while remote, kick starts your job search, connects you with employers, and increases your visibility as a candidate. \u00a0 In person or remote, we remain committed to empowering life change and helping our students land jobs in new career fields.\u00a0If you\u2019ve been affected by COVID-19 in any way (layoffs, health, family, etc), check out our recently announced COVID-19 Relief Scholarship."}, {"title": "The Remote Codeup Student Experience", "content": "Communities across Texas have now lived in a remote environment for weeks. While we hoped for good news early on, Governor Abbott\u2019s recent announcement to close schools for the remainder of the school year has confirmed that the new normal amid COVID-19 is remote. A lot of prospective students are left asking: what now? Our answer is simple: little has changed! While we are now conducting class digitally, the rest of the Codeup experience looks the same. Here\u2019s how! Codeup differs from traditional degrees and online programs because we offer live, full-time, and immersive instruction. Even now, our classes are taught by a team of passionate instructors whose backgrounds range from 20+ years of industry experience to Master Degrees in Adult Education. Each class is led by 2-3 expert instructors and supported by a Teaching Assistant. They deliver live lectures, respond to you in real-time, provide 1:1 support, and individualize your learning to set you up for success. Comparing us to an online boot camp is like comparing a virtual reality experience to a regular TV show. We\u2019re still giving live instruction, we\u2019re just teaching from behind a laptop instead of a podium. In addition to live instruction, our students enjoy live co-learning. You\u2019re not in this alone! In fact, our cohorts of 20-25 students provide a built-in structure of camaraderie, networking, and technical support. Some of the best learning you can do is by teaching to and learning from other students, a benefit that is lost in attending a part-time or self-paced program. The combination of live instruction and peer-peer connectivity produces a third benefit: accountability. In this remote world where your couch is your desk, it can be challenging to stay focused and motivated. Our immersive program builds accountability through a daily course schedule, project-based learning, social support, and a helping hand. [Editor\u2019s note: if this weren\u2019t important and learning to code on your own were easy, I\u2019d be writing Java right now instead of a blog post!] Lastly, the reason Codeup offers a 100% tuition refund guarantee is that we teach directly to the needs of employer partners. Right now, more than ever before, employers need employees who are adaptable and able to work remotely! The remote Codeup experience prepares you to communicate, collaborate, and code remotely, a skill that was already valuable in the tech industry. If anything, you\u2019re getting a little extra bang for your buck by learning a skillset most developers have to earn the hard way. Although we wish we were on campus high-fiving, writing code, and re-enacting Star Wars lightsabers battles, we\u2019ve realized that\u2019s not really what the Codeup experience is about. The true Codeup experience is about learning to code from experienced professionals alongside passionate students in a live, hands-on environment that offers a 100% tuition refund guarantee. That\u2019s what you can always expect from Codeup, whether we\u2019re remote or not.

I had fallen into the trap of working mindless jobs only to make ends meet. I was hungry for success and ready to transition from a \u201cjob\u201d to a \u201ccareer,\u201d but I did not know what would get me there. After conducting a lot of research, I came to the conclusion that the tech industry is where I wanted to get started, specifically as a web developer. Unfortunately, when I did a Google search for \u201ccoding bootcamp,\u201d I came across about 6,000,000 results. Some programs offered courses online, in-person, or a combination of the two. As for the financial options, programs either offered financial assistance or none at all. I was having a difficult time choosing the best program for me because I was left with so many questions. \u00a0 To find answers to my questions, I decided to schedule calls with the programs I was interested in. After talking to several bootcamps, I was able to narrow down my options. I needed a program located in San Antonio, TX that offered in-person learning and tuition assistance. This was when I knew Codeup was the best possible option for me. I wanted an in-person experience because I needed an environment that would help me find the success I was after. As I did my research on Codeup, it became clear that they were going to provide the best experience for me. Now that I graduated and am looking back, I know I made the right decision. While I could mention all of the many ways that Codeup changed my life, I want to share some of the benefits for any individuals considering going here. Every day, I was taught by experienced instructors from all types of backgrounds and with various teaching styles. I had an amazing cohort that shared the journey with me and I can confidently say that I have made lifelong friends. I was also surrounded by an amazing network of alumni, staff, employer partners, and the tech community in San Antonio. Everything about Codeup is so much more effective because it is in-person. One of my favorite experiences at Codeup was the career simulation and preparation. I was able to work one-on-one with a professional that is going to help place me in my first web developer position. I feel like none of this success would have been possible if I decided to take an alternate route through an online program or part-time environment.

I was actively applying for law enforcement positions because that was basically all I knew. My mother called me one afternoon and mentioned Codeup. She suggested I apply for the web development course. My first thoughts were, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can become a REAL developer in 18 weeks and, if I get in, I won\u2019t\u00a0 be able to keep up with the curriculum.\u201d But, there was no risk in applying, so I did. The admissions process was smooth and any questions I had were answered by Codeup staff. Then I was accepted into the web development course! The course was challenging, but every challenge felt like an opportunity to grow. Each lesson was structured and easy to follow. The instructors give real world examples and encouraged engagement through questions and ideas. The exercises had requirements, but no limits, which allows for multiple solutions and endless possibilities. As the course progressed, I knew this was for me.\u00a0 Towards the end of the course, the Codeup staff connected me with potential employers based on what I was looking for. Shortly after completing the course, I received an offer letter from a software company that provides data tracking software to non-profits.\u00a0 I love my job. I get to build cool stuff that helps make a difference in the world while growing as a Software Engineer. My advice for anyone considering Codeup is to reach out to admissions.

During your research, you\u2019ve probably seen a few different curricula. Without already BEING a software developer, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s what. In this post, we want to explore how to think about a bootcamp curriculum and recommend strategies about how to consider the best fit. Let\u2019s start with some terminology. Full-stack web development integrates work on both the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is the user-facing side that you interact within a web browser. The back-end is the server-side that involves the sending and receiving of data. Consider a restaurant website. A front-end only website would show a restaurant menu with prices, dishes, and ordering information. A full-stack web application would allow you to not only view the menu but place an order and process payment information for that order, interacting with a database and back-end functionality. Within that understanding, there are a few groupings of technologies: With so many technologies out there, it can be hard to pick what\u2019s best to learn. But here\u2019s the secret: the specific technologies do not matter. The most important thing you\u2019ll learn during a coding bootcamp is how to use these different categories of technologies. Whether you learn PHP or Java, MySQL, or\u00a0 SQL Server, the important takeaways are the fundamental concepts learned. Many Codeup alumni graduate from our Full-Stack Java program and go on to work in PHP, Python, Ruby, Groovy, and other languages. Ultimately, a loop is a loop and an array is an array. Languages differ, but once you\u2019ve learned an OOP language, the differences become syntactical instead of conceptual.\u00a0 This leads us to an important point: the more technologies, the worse! The quality of a curriculum, and thus the value of it, is not defined by the number of technologies covered. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. Let\u2019s give some examples. Columbia University is one of the premier academic institutions in the world. They are an Ivy League university with a strong reputation. In 2018, they expanded into the bootcamp space and launched a web development program that covers the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, Git, and more. All of that in 12 weeks. Let\u2019s decode that for you with the terms we\u2019ve already used. This curriculum promises to teach you: Now let\u2019s look at Codeup. We teach: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Java, Spring, MySQL. All of that, in 22 weeks. In the terms we\u2019ve discussed, that\u2019s:\u00a0 The common initial thought is: why spend 22 weeks learning seven technologies when you could spend 12 weeks learning 10? And there lies the misconception. Many bootcamp curricula promise to teach you the latest and greatest technologies: React.js, Angular.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, etc. etc. etc. That may sound like a better bang for your buck, but it\u2019s all a question of priority. Here is the reality of your choices: There is no inherently right answer here \u2013 it\u2019s all about your priorities. That being said, here\u2019s what we believe: Learning how to learn, learning how to think like a developer, and learning to program is far more important than gaining exposure to the latest web frameworks. When you understand programming fundamentals, you prepare yourself to learn whatever you want. It\u2019s like learning how to work with a car: it\u2019s great to know how to drive an Audi, but it\u2019s pretty different from understanding how an Audi engine works and how it differs from a Honda.\u00a0 At Codeup, we focus on crafting you into a software developer. We focus on programming fundamentals, core web technologies, and applied practices. When you graduate, you\u2019re ready to land a job and have the skills to learn any technology.

But we\u2019re new to town here in Dallas, so we\u2019re getting a lot of questions. Top of that list is, \u201cWhy are y\u2019all so much more expensive than the other bootcamps in town?\u201d In case you haven\u2019t noticed, our Full-Stack Web Development program tuition is an investment of $27,500. But the secret is, we don\u2019t cost that much \u2013 we\u2019re worth that much. Codeup isn\u2019t a bootcamp \u2013 it\u2019s a career accelerator. Tuition is an investment in your future, and the ROI pays off. Let\u2019s dive into why! First of all, the upfront investment to enroll at Codeup is only $1,000 \u2013 a down payment to secure your seat. The entirety of the rest of your tuition can be arranged with a combination of scholarships, grants, and loans to support the remaining investment. Our dedicated Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager helps you navigate all the intricacies of tuition planning (if you want to get a head start, read our blog about bootcamp funding, explained). Codeup focuses on quality. While other bootcamps leveraged venture-funding and corporate capital to expand quickly, opening 10+ campuses at a time, Codeup opened one campus. While other programs focused on volume, we focused on quality. We spent five years refining our program before expanding. Here\u2019s the result that you now get to enjoy: If you\u2019re considering a bootcamp education, you\u2019re really considering an investment in yourself. Let\u2019s be really clear \u2013 this is NOT school. This isn\u2019t a high school diploma, an Associate\u2019s or a BS in CS. This is a pathway to a career, the salary that will earn, and the meaning it will bring. Put on your investment hat: the upfront $$ isn\u2019t as important as the Return On Investment. Our Dallas-bound graduates have had an average starting salary of $85,000. At less than 6 months long, you still have more than 6 months to work in that year. So what is your ROI? In the same year you are trained, you earn back your money. Within 12 months, you 3x your money. You might ask, why not use that same math on a cheaper program? The answer is simple: other bootcamps don\u2019t view it the same way. They are giving you an education, you are giving them a return on THEIR investment. Let\u2019s take a more specific look: "}, {"title": "The Best Path To A Career In Software Development", "content": "\u201cDon\u2019t I need a Computer Science degree to get a job as a software developer?\u201d As a non-traditional educational model, we hear this concern a lot. Prospective students often compare us to four year degrees in CS with the concern that lacking a piece of paper and formal degree will prevent them from getting a job. We\u2019re here to tell you once and for all: college is NOT the best way to become a software developer. For the avoidance of doubt, there is a lot of merit to a four year degree, as well as a lot of valuable knowledge from a CS program that can apply to life as a developer. However, if your goal is to get a job as a software developer, there\u2019s a more direct path. Think of it this way:my plumbing is old and broken, and I need to replace it all. I hire a PhD in Fluid Dynamics \u2013 someone who really understands flow, gravity, resistance, momentum, and all the intricacies of what\u2019s happening in my pipes. They come and explain how everything is supposed to work in my new pipes, charge me $5,000 for their time, and then leave. With my pipes still broken, I decided to hire a plumber \u2013 someone who knows how to identify the problem and fix it,and a week later my plumbing is fully functional and I\u2019ve only spent $2,500. [Note, we kind of made these numbers up to illustrate a point. After all, we\u2019re no drain surgeons.] The message here is simple: theory is not the same thing as practical experience. With the rapid growth in web and IT, we\u2019re no longer just dealing with cutting-edge technologies. Development is becoming the new blue-collar factory work, and the amount of code out there is astounding. It\u2019s no longer as important to have high-level abstract education. Instead, the top priority is up-to-date practical experience. Now, let\u2019s get more specific. Why exactly is a coding bootcamp the better way to get a job as a software developer? #1 Technologies: Technology changes at the speed of light. One day the popular framework is Angular, and the next it\u2019s React. In one generation, companies are building with C++ and in the next they\u2019re building with Java. Because of this rate of change, it\u2019s hard for traditional learning environments to keep pace. While they continue to teach C++, we\u2019ve moved on to Java with a Spring framework and MySQL database. Because we\u2019re more agile, we are able to keep pace with industry trends. #2 Curriculum structure: Have you ever watched Top Chef or The Great British Bake Off? You were probably pretty entertained, but how did that seared Ahi Tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduce amuse-bouche turn out? The sad reality is, watching experts do their thing doesn\u2019t make you an expert. Nor does listening to lectures. Our program is built around the concept of praxis, which is essentially the practical application of theory, or the blending of theory and practice. Half of your 670 program hours are spent actually writing code, so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming. This career is like an old-time trade, like becoming a blacksmith: you have to learn from masters and practice, practice, practice. #3 Job placement services: If education is your goal, stop reading now. If a career is your goal, then you\u2019re in the right place. Most undergraduate institutions have career service offices where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fairs. But Codeup makes you a promise: get a job after graduation or get 100% of your money back. There are no two ways about that: our singular focus is your outcome. Unlike traditional institutions, we sell jobs, not education.\u00a0 #4 Programming hours: This is similar to number 2, but so important that it\u2019s worth repeating. The single most important thing a would-be developer can do is spend time writing code. Practice, practice, practice is the lesson above all else. You need to engage with the problem-solving cycle, learn how to fail, and learn to overcome the barriers inherent in programming. It\u2019s a lot like learning an instrument. When you start out, you struggle to play single notes. You then practice scales and exercises, and before long you\u2019re playing songs, thinking about the intonation and sound over playing the notes. With programming, you need to spend hours to get the basics under your fingers in order to graduate to complex problem-solving and application development. At Codeup, you spend 670 hours in hands-on, instructor-led classroom time. For those of you who like math, that\u2019s roughly equivalent to the number of hours in a four-year degree. It just happens in 6 months, and those hours are hands-on. If you\u2019re still not convinced, consider the story of Po. Po graduated from Trinity University with a 4 year degree in Computer Science. He graduated with a good GPA, but couldn\u2019t find work as a web developer for a whole year. Companies told him he didn\u2019t have enough full-stack experience, a big enough portfolio, and was lacking modern technologies and languages. So, he came to Codeup. He paired his theory knowledge with our practical knowledge and landed a job immediately upon graduation. Since then, he\u2019s moved to Dallas to join Cognizant, where he\u2019s been able to double his salary and move into a new position as a lead developer. Learn more about Po\u2019s journey here.

In January 2020, our second class is cranking through their final capstone projects, in which they take a Data Science project to life. As we gear up to launch our 3rd class in February 2020, let\u2019s take a moment to introduce you to the incredible data science instructors ready to help you change careers.\u00a0 Between them, Maggie Giust, Zach Gulde, and Ryan Orsinger have over 20 years of technical industry experience. They\u2019ve worked as data analysts, data scientists, software developers, curriculum developers, instructors, and more. They\u2019ve worked at large companies like Rackspace and HEB, and smaller companies like Whiskr and Grok Interactive. Together, they have over 12 years of teaching experience at Codeup and the university level As we\u2019ve talked about before (see: What is Data Science blog), Data Science is the intersection of programming, math/stats, and domain expertise. That means that in order to learn this material and make a successful career transition, it\u2019s even more important in this field than any other to have a diverse set of instructor backgrounds. Let\u2019s break down our staff expertise by those categories: Domain expertise: Domain expertise means having deep technical experience AND applying that experience across multiple industries and domains.\u00a0 Maggie has worked in data science for 7 years and data roles for 10. Maggie worked in finance, practicing data science for security intelligence with Capital Group, built machine learning recommender systems for consumer retail at HEB, and produced data science insights at Rackspace to improve customer satisfaction.\u00a0 Prior to joining Codeup, Maggie\u2019s educational experience includes teaching high school math as well as the development and delivery of data science content and curriculum at both Codeup and Trinity University, where she serves as an adjunct instructor of data science. Zach has been instructing, writing curriculum, and programming internal applications for Codeup since 2016. He has instructed hundreds of programmers and is Codeup\u2019s principle curriculum developer. If you printed out all the curriculum Zach has authored for both Data Science and Web Development, it would be more than 1000 pages. In addition to his work with Codeup, Zach has worked on big data projects in the travel industry. Ryan began building web applications for small and medium-sized businesses in 2007 and has written software ranging from custom CRM systems for real estate brokerages to an event management platform for Dell. As Codeup\u2019s most senior instructor, Ryan has instructed and mentored 37 data scientists and over 500 software developers. This means that you will learn what businesses value from instructors who are experienced practitioners who have created technical solutions for multiple industries. Math/Stats: Maggie holds a BS in Mathematics from UTSA and is currently working on her Master\u2019s degree in Data Analytics. Ryan holds a BA from Trinity University in economics. In addition to building out the statistics curriculum for Codeup\u2019s Data Science program, Zach is working on his degree in Software Development. One of our students said they learned more in one week of stats at Codeup than an entire semester at college.\u00a0 Programming: This is really where we shine! Zach and Ryan have been teaching at Codeup for 4 years in our web development program and have developed special depth of expertise in programming and teaching programming. They each have experience across OOP in Java, PHP, and Python, as well as database experience in SQL and web framework expertise in Laravel and Spring. They each have experience in both object oriented and functional programming, and experience building database-backed full-stack web applications in numerous languages (including Python, Java, Javascript, and Clojure) and web frameworks. Maggie has been working in R and Python for years in her different data science roles. When it comes to programming, these 3 can not only build you a Machine Learning model, but they can build a full-stack application, hosting infrastructure, database, and simple UI to go along with it. What does this mean for you? When you join Codeup, you step into a classroom where the diverse skills needed in the field are represented in spades in your instructional staff. Not only that, but these are three incredible human beings with a passion for education and up-leveling others.

You\u2019re a software developer?\u201d. I, like many others that have graduated from Codeup, don\u2019t fit the mold most people think of when they think of people in tech. To be honest, I can barely believe that I am one as well. Throughout 12 years in school, I was a straight C or D student when it came to math or science and wasn\u2019t super excited about college. When I graduated, instead of going to college, I became a missionary in Colombia for two years. Colombia was an intense, immersive experience and I figured that when I got back to the States I would try out college. The results?\u00a0I lasted a semester in college and did horrible in my science class. My first week in college and I called a Marine Corps recruiter to let him know that I would be joining as soon as possible. College just wasn\u2019t for me. A week after my first semester and I was in boot camp. I spent the next 5 years in The Marine Corps mostly as a military working dog handler, trainer and instructor. It was honestly the best job I ever had. Unfortunately, the military had other plans for me that didn\u2019t involve working with dogs, so I got out and worked as a private security dog handler at the Baghdad embassy for a short time. I figured this was the next logical step. I came to find out that the job sounded good on paper, but sitting at a guard shack for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, left me feeling unfulfilled and wanting more out of my life. A week before going back to Baghdad for the last time, I was toying with the idea of coding and came across Codeup. I was accepted into the program a couple of days later and left for Baghdad and started once I returned. Compared to all my life experiences, Codeup was mentally one of the hardest things I\u2019ve accomplished. But if I can do it, so can you. What would have taken me years and years to accomplish, took me about 5 months. Less than two weeks after I graduated Codeup I was offered a job as a software developer at a well-known company where I\u2019ll start in about a week. The decision to go to Codeup, give it my all and come out the other side a software developer- will affect my life in every way and also that of my future family. I\u2019m grateful for all the staff and instructors there and thankful that I don\u2019t just have a graduation certificate, but the actual skills I need to succeed for the rest of my life."}, {"title": "Are Coding Schools Regulated In Texas?

I have had a lot of random odd jobs before going to Codeup, everything from customer service, to logging, to a cruise ship deckhand, to bartender.\u201d What made you interested in coding? And what made you decide to pull the trigger and look for ways to make it your career? \u201cI was in Military Intelligence in the Army, and when I transitioned out, I decided to stay in intel and went to UTSA to get a CS degree to be in Cyber Security.\u201d How did you end up coming to Codeup? \u201cI was bottlenecked in my degree plan (required to take a few prerequisite classes before I could proceed with my degree) at UTSA and decided that I didn\u2019t want to spend another three semesters trying to get passed those classes. Codeup cut that time significantly for a very similar outcome at a cheaper price, so that\u2019s what I chose.\u201d What has your experience been like here? \u201cVery challenging, but rewarding as well. My classmates were always there for each other when we needed help and generally went out of our way to help. That along with the enormous amount of knowledge made it a difficult but enjoyable experience.\u201d What would you tell people considering a career in software development? \u201cPractice. Without consistent practice, it is beyond difficult to learn and just as hard to retain. Keep programming even when you don\u2019t need to. Learning doesn\u2019t stop when class is over or when you\u2019re graduated.

I\u2019m passionate about technology, software, human behavior, and teaching. As we prepare to launch our first cohort in Dallas, I want to share why I decided to teach at Codeup. \u00a0 Quick about me: I\u2019m a self-taught developer! I have enjoyed an 18 year career in tech, during which I\u2019ve worked at companies ranging from small startups to Fortune 50 and made my way up through the ranks to Senior Developer. I\u2019ve also worked as an instructor at another coding bootcamp and a CTO of a local startup.\u00a0 \u00a0 How did I hear about Codeup? I saw them post on Slack! I was excited about the idea of returning to teaching, and reached out. We began talking, and I spent over a dozen hours getting to know their team, from management to instruction. During our conversations, I made up my mind: I wanted to work for Codeup. Here\u2019s why! \u00a0 #1: Codeup has a well-thought-out and high-quality curriculum. Not only that, but it teaches programming fundamentals. Some bootcamps teach programs that cover a dozen different technologies: React, Angular, Node, Ruby, Rails, Mongo DB, MySQL, Python, etc. As a developer, I can tell you: that\u2019s crazy. Instead of a list of keywords, I discovered Codeup teaches a narrow scope of technologies with a focus on teaching students how to learn software development, giving them the power to go learn whatever technologies they want. \u00a0 #2: Codeup promises, and follows through, to refund 100% of a student\u2019s tuition if they don\u2019t find a job after graduation. A lot of places say, \u2018Hey come on over, we\u2019ll help!\u2019 I knew Codeup was for real and not just a money grab when they told me: \u201cif a student does everything they\u2019re supposed to and doesn\u2019t find a job, that\u2019s on us, not them.\u201d \u00a0 #3: Codeup has an impressive network of employer partners. They place graduates at companies like USAA, Accenture, Oracle, SWBC, and other large companies with a reputation. Having worked at a bootcamp, I know exactly how hard it is to get a company like USAA to consider bootcamp grads. That upped their cred in my book WAY high. \u00a0 #4: Codeup accepts the GI Bill. In my eyes, the government legitimized them with their stamp of approval. \u00a0 Lastly, and most importantly, Codeup helped me realize my passion for helping bring other people into this amazing field. I\u2019m so excited that I get to teach at Codeup, and help so many find a career they love. If you want to learn to code or start a new career, reach out to us \u2013 we\u2019d love for you to decide to learn at Codeup."}, {"title": "How A Year of Life Change Lead Me To Codeup", "content": "This time last year I was a college student majoring in Kinesiology and decided to take a step down from management roles to focus on school.

Tito Bradshaw lived life to the fullest and was a leader in the cycling community. This death kickstarted me onto a path to change my life and do more than I ever thought I was capable of. Like Tito, I decided to go on an adventure and explore New York, push my body past its limits in strength and endurance and somehow I ended up in the right place at the right time and met some people from Codeup. I always thought I would just be in sales my entire life and have an uneventful life, this year I have done more than I could have ever imagined.

Now, after honing its curriculum and strengthening its ties across the state, Codeup is ready to open its second campus in Dallas. Near the end of November, with the greenlight from the Texas Workforce Commission, the company began accepting applications for its first North Texas cohort that will begin in downtown Dallas in early 2020. It plans to have about 3 cohorts go through its 20-week program, graduating between 50 to 75 people next year. \u201cIt seems to make good sense that we should be here; the number of jobs is more than the number of people that can do them and that\u2019s what makes it such a great opportunity right now,\u201d\u00a0Jason Straughan, CEO and co-founder of Codeup, told NTX Inno. \u201cWe want to make sure that we are getting the people that come through our classes jobs, we want our Dallas cohorts to have the same or better employment rates than they do in San Antonio.\u201d What started in the corner of a coworking space in San Antonio, with people walking in and out of the space while trying to teach the class, has quickly become a well-recognized organizations for helping people transition into coding and data careers. It started with a problem Straughan and his fellow co-founders noticed in the industry. Applicants would come in for interviews at their respective companies with a wealth of knowledge about theory, but when it came to practicality and implementation, they seemed to be lacking. \u201cWe were talking about how college is teaching people to be computer scientists like you would teach an astronomer how a telescope works,\u201d Straughan said. So Codeup was launched with a simple premise \u2013 teach software development like you would teach a skilled trade, with immersive learning. Over the course of the company\u2019s 20-week program, students start coding on day one. The classes go from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and by the end of it, students log about 630 classroom hours of direct experience. \u201cIt\u2019s day one you start writing code,\u201d Straughan said. \u201cHow do you learn German? You speak it. How do you learn to code? It\u2019s fingers on keyboards, and so that\u2019s what we do.\u201d Codeup distinguishes itself from the numerous other similar programs out there in that it is outcome-driven, rather than profit-motivated. The co-founders of the organization are all involved in the tech industry outside of Codeup, allowing them to focus more on the curriculum than a business plan. Straughan said that in the beginning, instead of thinking about what students want to learn, Codeup went directly to the companies that would be hiring graduates and asked what skills were needed. This has given Codeup a high job placement rate for its graduates, with more than 98 percent of alumni finding jobs in the industry. Codeup stands by its program, offering graduates a complete refund if they are unable to find a software-related job within six months. \u201cNow that we are growing, we\u2019re trying to do it slow to make sure that we maintain that kind of quality on the output, because we think that\u2019s the long-term goal,\u201d Straughan said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s actually the most responsible way to deliver and education product.\u201d Straughan credits Codeup\u2019s 28-member team with the success of the company. The connections made from previous graduates has, in part, driven Codeup\u2019s expansion to Dallas. In the past year, the organization has placed 17 graduates in the North Texas area with large companies like USAA and Cognizant. In addition, he said that the growth of the tech industry in the region has made it attractive not only for its relatively high tech salaries, but also because of the number of job openings. When it opens next year in Dallas, Codeup will also focus on helping drive diversity and inclusion in the local tech workforce. The company strives to have cohorts that represent the larger demographics of the region. It also offers scholarships for disadvantaged and minority residents looking to apply. Straughan said that it is something the tech industry should be talking about more, because the software that is being developed is used by all types of people, and those people should be represented at the development of the software as well. \u201cI think one of the other things we really enjoy about Codeup is when I entered software development, almost everybody in that career looked like me \u2013 they were all white dudes that liked to play with computers\u2026 the industry is changing and it is becoming more diverse, and I think we have an opportunity to help kickstart that and speed up that process,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized that the impact we are making is really a cool experience, it\u2019s moving to me, it really is a purpose.\u201d"}, {"title": "How I Paid $43 For My Codeup Tuition", "content": "Bootcamps or career accelerator programs are short term education programs designed to help you learn new skills and find a job. If you are thinking about attending one, I will share some tips about finding a bootcamp, my story about how I chose to attend Codeup in San Antonio, TX and how I got funding to attend. My first tip is to spend at least a few months to a year researching the topic you want to study and the bootcamps available. There are tons of resources online to learn programming. I will provide a detailed table below of the courses I took, most of which are free. While you are learning the basics, start to learn about the bootcamps that teach this subject, read through bootcamp curriculum, take notes on tuition costs and start dates and note whether or not they provide scholarships. This first step is crucial for figuring out if this topic is something you are genuinely interested in. Secondly, when you start researching bootcamps, you will find that cost of tuition can be high. The best strategy is to look simultaneously look for funding and bootcamps. First look locally and seek out local and federal grants to attend based on being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field (minorities). I was only able to find funding because I met with a local career training program which enabled me to access local and Department of Labor funds. If you don\u2019t meet the criteria of being being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field, then don\u2019t worry! There are still other scholarships and loans out there. Warning!\u2014only start to contact/call up the bootcamps when you are comfortable with your basic skills in programming (or whatever you are trying to learn) and when you are committed to attending. Bootcamp admissions will aggressively seek you out. They want you to attend their courses. You should have clear intentions about what you want to do, how much money you want to spend, and how good you are at programming. Just be honest with the people you speak to about your circumstances. This is a process so take your time. Often, if you get rejected from a bootcamp, you can still re-apply later. Lastly, there are almost always loan companies that specialize in loan for students of bootcamps. If the cost of tuition is still prohibitive, you can consider loans as your last option. In most cases, these loans can be repaid easily with the job you will (hopefully, most likely) get after you graduate. Some bootcamps offer refunds if you don\u2019t get a job (with conditions) and others offer deferred tuition where you don\u2019t pay anything until you get your first job. As for my experience, I learned about Data Science online and spent 10 months researching the subject and bootcamps. I took a slew of courses online to learn the basics, which I will share below. Then I started to apply to bootcamps. Ultimately, I was able to find Codeup in my hometown. I visited their campus and spoke with their admissions representative about funding. I loved that this school was in my hometown, so it was a practical choice for a full-time program. I also liked the instructors and admissions people that I met. The admissions person told me about their funding options and sent me to a local career training program, which informed me about local and federal grants that were not easily accessible online. Working with this local program was long and uncertain but I stuck with it. The real reasons I was able to get funding through them were because I had been under-employed for years, I had used up all my savings, I was living at home with family and I was unemployed at the time that I applied for the funding. In the end, I chose Codeup because I was able to find funding, it was in my hometown and I genuinely liked the people I met there, especially Maggie Giust, the Senior Data Scientist. I will share a table of the exact funding amounts that I got below. This will probably not be the norm. I got extremely lucky with my funding. All in all, this whole process is precarious, scary and hard. You should give yourself plenty of time to research and learn about the process, the bootcamps and the subject you are trying to study.

In business since 2004, Quickpath has helped deliver amazing customer experiences and optimize business decisions in over a hundred implementations for Fortune 500 and Fortune 1,000 companies. But as the demand for their services increased\u2014more than doubling each of the past three years\u2014Quickpath found itself in a talent shortage.\u00a0 \u201cWe found ourselves leaving business on the table where customers were asking us for additional resources,\u201d Alex Fly, CEO of Quickpath and board member of the Codeup Data Science program, said, \u201cand we weren\u2019t able to fill that request.\u201d Fortunately, the Codeup Data Science curriculum was able to provide a much-needed pipeline of highly skilled individuals. Over the course of an intense 20-week, hands-on program, students learn a variety of data science tools and skills, including statistics, SQL, Python and regression analysis. This intense preparation, culminating in mastery with a capstone project, is what led Fly to hire not one, but three of our Codeup grads from the inaugural Data Science cohort. Codeup Data Science Grads Making an Immediate Impact Quickpath is a company that plays data science as a team sport\u2014they really help their clients with all operations around data rather than simply creating a model. This means that Quickpath helps their clients in all the following areas:\u00a0 \u00a0 Quickpath hired the three Codeup grads as data and machine learning (ML) engineers to work on tasks that come both before and after data model creation. And while you may think of a data science professional as being tucked away in a room doing analysis, this role at Quickpath is very customer-facing, and within a week of being hired, the Codeup grads were already interacting with a number of Quickpath customers. While such a short runway to customer interaction may evoke some nervousness in a new college graduate, the new Codeup hires were able to tap into their previous professional experience and jump right in. Leveraging Previous Experiences for a Data Science Role Fly credits the immediate success of the new Codeup grads to their previous professional experience. While they may not have been in a data science role, these Codeup hires had worked in a corporate environment for years, often using data and analytic skills.\u00a0 One individual, in particular, had been on the receiving end of information from a data science model. In their previous position as an analyst in fraud detection, they would receive data model outputs in order to assess whether transactions were fraudulent.\u00a0 After completing the Codeup Data Science program, this person now sits on the other side of the fence and has the ability to wrangle the data, develop a model and evaluate its success. His professional experience is what sets him apart: he keenly understands how front-line employees will interact with the data that he provides. Fly believes it\u2019s this kind of professional experience that empowers Codeup graduates to hit the ground running.\u00a0 But there\u2019s something more than just previous professional experience. It\u2019s also the sense that Codeup graduates are intrinsically motivated to make a major career change. As our first 2019 Data Science outcomes report noted, 77% of the class had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. A person looking to change careers who invests in a 20-week program shows not only moxie but also curiosity.\u00a0 \u201cData science is constantly moving and evolving at a very high pace. There\u2019s a new library, modeling or deep learning framework coming out literally every week\u2014you\u2019ve got to constantly stay on top of your game,\u201d Fly explained. \u201cSo being able to identify folks who are lifelong learners has been a critical success factor for our hiring profile. We found a pretty high concentration of those folks at Codeup.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Looking Forward: Advice for Future Codeup Data Science Students The demand for professionals with knowledge of data science is not going away anytime soon. Business is continuing to boom for Fly and Quickpath, and he is already looking forward to the next round of graduates. And for those looking to enroll in a future Codeup Data Science boot camp, he has two pieces of advice. First, Fly emphasizes the importance of data, data, data, underscoring that it\u2019s more important than all the algorithms of the world. He believes data preparation is the most fundamental skill to master.\u00a0 \u201cAn average data scientist with really good data will always be able to build a better model than an expert data scientist with data,\u201d Fly stressed. Second, he advises that in order to be successful in this field, a person must have a love of learning and can never rest on their laurels. \u201cIf you sit still for six months, your skills are out of date,\u201d he advised. \u201cYou must have a thirst for knowledge and an \u2018always-on\u2019 learning mentality.\u201d \u00a0 Are you looking to reboot your career and become a data scientist or computer programmer?

Learn more here. \u2014 Codeup is San Antonio\u2019s premier career accelerator, and we\u2019ve been proud to build the tech workforce here over the last five years. Now, we\u2019re excited to bring our mission of creating pathways to Software Development and Data Science careers to more people. Dallas, we have our eyes set on you! After five years exclusively focused on San Antonio, why expand now? As the bootcamp model has grown, we\u2019ve watched our competitors expand nationally, open dozens of campuses, buy and sell to and from each other, launch coworking spaces, and more. Meanwhile, we believe the outcomes of our graduates far outweigh the number of campuses we have. We have refined our curriculum, built our team, expanded our partnership network, and built a brand people can trust. Where did we all end up? Many of our competitors have closed or sold. We\u2019re still Texas-based, owned by our founders, and our investment in quality has brought our graduate placement rate to 97% over the last 18 months. So what\u2019s next? With our product refined, we were ready to expand. We looked at cities all over the country, but quickly realized we didn\u2019t want a second Codeup, or a third. Instead, we need additional campuses to belong to one cohesive Codeup. So we didn\u2019t pick a city, we picked a state.\u00a0 Texas has the 10th largest economy in the world and has over 50 company headquarters from the Fortune 500 list. All four of our major cities (Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio) have high demand for tech talent, offer a welcoming place to live and do business, and are home to a large veteran population ready for the jobs of tomorrow. We are not creating a second Codeup, but we are opening another campus. The time is right, and Texas is ready.\u00a0 Dallas jumped to the top of our list to start with because we\u2019ve already placed our graduates there at companies like USAA and Cognizant for average starting salaries of $86,666. We focus on job outcomes, so we go where our partnerships lead. That way, we can live our mission of empowering life change and launching careers in technology. We\u2019ve secured a space in the heart of downtown Dallas, where students will have access to vibrant city life and dozens of employers.

"}, {"title": "Data Science in the Real World", "content": "For some, it may be difficult to grasp how prevalent data science is in our world! We\u2019ve written a post here that brings to life some of the ways in which you may see data science in your everyday routine. However, you may find yourself wondering exactly how far-reaching data science actually is, or how it actually impacts certain industries or companies. In this post, I\u2019ll go a little deeper into these topics. For one, data science has been a major player in industries like manufacturing and retail. For example, in manufacturing, data science is utilized from an insight-driven perspective. Simply put, it\u2019s how businesses use data to figure out how to best utilize their resources when making and producing a large-scale product they\u2019re trying to sell to customers. For instance, a business may collect data on how the customer interacts with the product in order to figure out what features are most profitable to produce. They may also collect data related to how well the machinery is operating on the production line so they can analyze weak points and optimize efficiency. For example, Ford utilizes wireless connections and in-vehicle sensors to capture insights on driver behavior as well as ways to increase production speed.  In retail, we also see a similar move towards an insight-driven perspective, one that allows businesses to use predictive analytics by utilizing data from product reviews, call center records, and social media streams. On a merchandising front, businesses like Target and Walmart may even utilize data collected from video footage or track heat signatures in order to improve layout and product placements. If you have ever wondered why you can\u2019t walk out of Target without spending at least a hundred bucks, now you know why! Basic industrial-organizational psychology usually places the most utilized items, like milk and eggs, in a place further into the store so that customers must walk past a plethora of products that they don\u2019t need but may end up buying due to product placement.   What has become even more significant than brick-and-mortar stores, however, are online retailers, such as Amazon. Because of the huge variety of items to choose from, many customers may feel overwhelmed by how many options there are when they visit the website. However, because Amazon is so great at collecting data on customers and then turning that raw data into valuable predictors, they make it much easier for the average consumer to buy products suited for them. For example, to figure out what items to recommend users, they collect data on what items that user browses through and what they end up buying. Amazon also takes into account the user\u2019s shipping address, which lets them reliably predict what income a user may have.   All these little tidbits of information allow them to build a 360-degree model of who this individual so that they can associate them with a group of people that also have the same identifiers. Grouping users can help Amazon make assumptions about what you will buy based on what others buy in your grouping. If you buy Burt\u2019s Bees Lip Balm with a predicted income of 53k, they may come to the conclusion that people in this category also have a high rate of buying Bounty Quick-Size Paper Towels, which they can then recommend you buy next. In many ways, it\u2019s exactly like what Target does with product placement when someone walks into the store. However, because Amazon lacks a physical storefront they must instead strategically place products around the web page in order to create the same passerby effect. \u00a0  On a larger scale, this is essentially how advertising works on all the social media platforms you may find yourself scrolling through. One one hand, they may collect data on you in order to predict which advertisements your group of users may relate with. However, they may also track your individual data and essentially stalk you with little bits of code called cookies. For example, one time while scrolling through Instagram, I saw an ad for my absolute favorite chai brand that\u2019s manufactured in the town of my alma mater, the University of Colorado at Boulder. I caught myself thinking, \u201c How in the world did they know?\u201d The ad was so specific to my preferences that it caught me off guard. I\u2019m assuming at some point I had Googled this brand of chai and the browser cookies were used by Instagram to target users with that specific interest, which is in general how most targeted advertising works. The weird part is, I couldn\u2019t recall ever Googling it\u2026   The fact of the matter is, many businesses are collecting data on behaviors you may not even realize. Some say that Facebook records users through their phones or that Alexa is listening to you without your knowledge. The truth is, we have reached an age in which data is a highly valued commodity. As demonstrated by the near failure of footwear company Timberland, how a company uses data can either make or break them. As data becomes increasingly important in our world, the demand for data scientists will be even higher. \u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in becoming a data scientist, check out Codeup\u2019s program here. It\u2019s a 22-week hands-on accelerator that will teach you all the technical skills you need to know in order to jumpstart a career in Data Science. \u00a0 \u2014  Joyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

At the time I was living a carefree life with a close friend. I hadn\u2019t considered what the next year of my life would look like, let alone the next decade. I didn\u2019t really see myself as a soldier, but I was strongly encouraged to enlist and so I did.\u00a0 It was during this time that I began playing around with building websites. I was far from good at it, but I enjoyed it, a lot. In April of 2018 I found out about coding bootcamps. I had never considered that I could make a living as a web developer. I didn\u2019t even know what a web developer did. But it turns out that developers do the things that I enjoyed so much that I stayed up all night doing them.\u00a0 At the time I was managing a small cafe, making $11 an hour. I was also a part-time uber driver to help make ends meet. It sucked, big time. \u00a0It was at this time that I made the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. I quit that job and decided to focus on teaching myself how to code while I researched coding bootcamps that would allow me to use the remaining months I had left of my GI-Bill.\u00a0 It was important to me that the school be reputable, care about their students and have a solid track record of getting students a job.\u00a0 Codeup met all those requirements. Before attending Codeup, I decided that if I was going to risk the time and money it would require to improve my life and take a chance on something I knew I truly enjoyed I\u2019d have to do some things differently. I was going to have to give it 110% because if I failed at this I didn\u2019t want there to be any possibility that it was because I held anything back. I like to think that my military training kicked into overdrive. While at bootcamp, I arrived hours early, sometimes turning on the lights myself. Many evenings I stayed late to study and work on projects. I took pride in everything I did, making each and every project better than the last and paying attention to the details. I stayed positive, took care of myself and made coding my life. I hardly watched any television at all, one of my favorite pastimes. I also developed some amazing friendships. I continuously modified my time and intentions at Codeup to shape the best outcome possible. Needless to say, this time around I was ready for it and bootcamp was one of the best experiences of my life.\u00a0\u00a0 Currently I work for Cognizant. It\u2019s the best job I\u2019ve ever had. It feels just like Codeup where I was constantly learning and loving every second of it. I work with all the friends I made at Codeup and the salary is\u2026 well, like everything else, a dream come true. There\u2019s absolutely nothing I would change about my experiences -Army bootcamp or coding bootcamp. I know without a doubt that because I attended both, I\u2019m living my best life!"}, {"title": "5 Common Excuses Keeping You From Breaking Into the Tech Field", "content": "Just a few months before starting at Codeup in the Redwood cohort, I was sitting in the football stadium at the University of Colorado at Boulder, pondering what I would do after graduation. The commencement speaker that year was Kate Fagan, a sports reporter and commentator at ESPN. In her speech, something she said stuck out to me: \u201cTry replacing \u2018should\u2019 with \u2018want\u2019 and, as frequently as you are able, make decisions with that rubric. Life is best when your \u2018should\u2019 and your \u2018want\u2019 are aligned.\u201d Sitting there in that stadium, I realized that I knew exactly what I should be doing after graduating, which was applying to attend graduate school for the next five years. But the actual truth was, I didn\u2019t know what I truly wanted. Did I really want to jump into something for five years that I wasn\u2019t completely sure about? With this in mind I moved to San Antonio after graduation, mostly to be closer to my family. One night at the dinner table, my brother-in-law mentioned several eye-catching billboards around town promoting a local coding bootcamp named Codeup. I had dabbled a bit in coding when I was in college, so my interest was immediately piqued. However, there were doubts nagging at the back of my mind. Am I even capable enough to attend an intensive coding bootcamp like this? I\u2019m not really a super logical person\u2026 Am I cut out for this? etc, etc. Despite having a ton of reservations about my capabilities and the usefulness of attending a boot camp, I decided to take a leap of faith. And just a year-and-a-half later, I celebrated my one year as a software developer at Armor in Richardson, TX. In some ways, it feels like a dream. The hard work I put in, the days and nights of impassioned coding, pushing through all the excuses\u2026 and finally landing a dream job?! It\u2019s a colorful blur. So that\u2019s why in this post, I want to address five common excuses that may be keeping you from considering a career in technology. At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really make sense to let your fears and nagging doubts keep you from the job of your dreams. This was one of the primary fears at the forefront of my mind when thinking about doing a complete shift to a technology career. And, as I went through Codeup, I heard this many times from my peers. To be honest, it doesn\u2019t ever fully go away. There are days even now at work where I think I\u2019m in over my head and that I don\u2019t belong there (Imposter Syndrome, anyone?). This fear completely disregards the fact that I\u2019m already doing it. The truth is, it isn\u2019t always easy. Technology is constantly changing, creating new problems and forcing those within the field to continuously find new solutions. At my company, even our most senior developers are learning something new every day. We all have our doubts sometimes, but those self-limiting beliefs shouldn\u2019t keep you from pursuing anything you set your mind to. Let me ask you something. What does a veteran, electrical technician, and college music teacher have in common? Well, there was at least one of each in my cohort at Codeup, and all of them excelled and went on to become software developers. Other characters in my cohort included a stay-at-home-mom, barista, marketing professional, and a chef. All of these, however, are just arbitrary labels. None of these people told themselves \u201cI\u2019m just going to be a barista forever, because that\u2019s who I am\u201d or \u201cMy personality only suits being in a teacher, so I\u2019m not going to try something different.\u201d The reality is, our self-concept is always constantly shifting. There was such a colorful diversity of backgrounds, personalities, and skill sets at Codeup, proving that there\u2019s no one type or mold of individual that can pursue a technology career. There are days where indeed this is the case for me, just \u201cheads down coding\u201d, but more often than not my days are filled with collaboration and communication with my teammates. When someone runs into a problem they don\u2019t have the knowledge to solve, they track down someone who does. When a few of us are working in the same codebase, we make sure to frequently communicate to make sure we\u2019re not stepping on each other\u2019s toes. On top of that, we get to be a part of producing the product, providing feedback and suggestions. There are very few days where I just sit at my desk all day, boring holes into my computer screen. Although my experience may certainly be atypical, the main point I\u2019m trying to make is that there is a large range of positions and cultures within the technology field. There are also other roles within the technology field beyond coding and data analytics, such as evangelists and solutions consultants. Both of these have lots of interaction with people and clients! Don\u2019t be afraid to try a few different things until you find your fit. Most of us at Codeup did not come in with prior experience in coding. The great thing about coding bootcamps is that they typically take you from 0 to 100 in a condensed period of time. They guide you through the entire process, allowing you to maximize your success, with everything from technical skills, networking, portfolio-building, and resume review. Even with bootcamps aside, there is a plethora of both paid and free resources online that give you the ability to learn a lot of the preliminary skills you would need. There are communities (e.g. Chingu) with the sole purpose of learning and building projects in new technologies. Experience can be gained, so seek out those resources. They\u2019re only a few keystrokes away.  One thing to note about the technology field is that it\u2019s becoming more and more heavily based on experience and not your formal education. Many companies will see the value in someone who has practical experience. The reality is that many companies are shifting towards seeking out individuals that can come in and hit the ground running with practical know-how instead of purely theoretical education. Although basic computer skills are necessary for success, it\u2019s probably not as much as you think. And like I mentioned above, being able to excel in this field is all about embracing change and learning to learn. You may think you\u2019re not tech savvy because you always have issues with your radio or you can\u2019t get your apps to work right or you get frustrated with your computer software for not doing what you want it to \u2013 all of these things are valid struggles. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there. The reality is this: Many of these skills can be learned. As you look into pursuing a career in the technology field, don\u2019t let these thought patterns keep you from getting where you want to be. Instead, ask yourself the real questions: Why do I want to do this? What kind of lifestyle do I see for myself? What am I passionate about? Excuses are excuses, not truths about you and your life. Set a vision and relentlessly pursue it, letting all these limiting beliefs slide off of you. They don\u2019t have to define your journey.

Knowing little to nothing about the city, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. All that had filtered down from the collective consciousness to my perception of the city was the obvious tourist attractions such as the Riverwalk, Alamo, and amazing Tex Mex. After spending a little under a year there, I came to fall in love with this city for reasons beyond what tourists can see in a weekend. The experience of its vibrant and proud Latino culture, flourishing art scene, and emphasis on community have left an indelible mark upon my life.  All this aside, a huge part of my experience in San Antonio was attending Codeup, a coding boot camp that allowed me to have the skills needed to make a complete career shift and also an insider\u2019s look into San Antonio\u2019s flourishing tech community. For those of you that have never had a local\u2019s perspective into the technology layer of San Antonio, I\u2019m here to explain five reasons you should consider beginning a data science career here. Although San Antonio is usually overshadowed by its northern neighbor Austin, it is actually a humble but bustling tech hotspot according to Inc., a weekly business magazine. Especially as Austin\u2019s infrastructure struggles to support its rapid expansion and population growth, corporations and talent have begun to siphon off to San Antonio, which is only an hour south. Cost-of-living is much lower compared to Austin and is an attractive option for anyone starting out in entry-level data science. Additionally, a 2018 CBRE report names San Antonio in the top 50 US markets for tech talent, and is rapidly rising. On top of that, San Antonio ranked first among small tech markets in millennial population growth, with 12.5 percent between 2011 and 2016. Brookings found even greater growth, more than 14 percent, among millennials in a January report. Where the talent goes, corporations will follow.  \u00a0\u00a0 People may not realize it, but San Antonio is home to lots of large corporations such as USAA, HEB, Accenture, Hulu, iHeartMedia, Booz Allen \u2014 the list goes on. A quick Google search for data science jobs in San Antonio will pull up over a hundred active openings, all from corporations like the ones listed above. Additionally, SA Works conducted an analysis of over 30 business and thousands of job posts and has projected a higher growth in local tech jobs in San Antonio than the national average. Many of the corporations named above were found to be actively hiring for these positions. Data Science is also considered one of the best jobs in America for 2019, which makes it especially attractive with San Antonio\u2019s affordable cost of living.  A tight-knit community means that it is much more accessible for individuals to find resources that will aid them towards their goals, i.e. to become a data scientist. With even just a few months in San Antonio, I was able to see how welcoming and supporting the tech community is. With tech conferences, meetups, workshops, hackathons, and startup competitions galore, the community is truly thriving. The hub of a lot of this activity is Geekdom, a coworking space that serves as the central place for technology nerds to gather. Much of this community has a united vision to see technology flourish in San Antonio. For example, Tech Bloc was an organization created to advocate for policies that attract technology companies and talent to San Antonio. Even Codeup itself was created in order to produce more tech talent in San Antonio and drive growth. With so many determined and passionate technology stakeholders in San Antonio, its growth is inevitable!   When I say \u201cwell-renowned\u201d, it\u2019s not because the majority of people talk about it. The thing about security is that\u2026 it\u2019s typically discreet. However, San Antonio is actually the\u00a0home of dozens of security startups, and some of the most prominent ones are nowhere near household names except perhaps for those that are familiar with the industry. Many of these companies would do well to not draw attention to themselves due to the nature of the work. In conjunction, the University of Texas at San Antonio has three separate cybersecurity centers, and one of them is the top-ranked program in the nation. In general, cybersecurity spending is growing globally, and this will, in turn, benefit the tech growth in San Antonio. \u00a0  Growing up, I would hear my parents tell me that you need to look at someone\u2019s wallet to know who they truly are. That is, it\u2019s important to know how someone spends their money. One way to tell that San Antonio cares about technology is seeing how the city invests in technology initiatives. For example, there\u2019s WiFi in eight of the city parks, solar-powered smartphone charging attached to benches, and even drones assisting in search and rescue operations. Additionally, the city and Bexar County have addressed the tech gap by budgeting up to 300,000 dollars to create a role for a chief talent and recruitment officer (CTRO). This individual, along with the local nonprofit Tech Bloc which administers the position, has a job that is two-fold: bringing in outside tech talent and matching local talent to organizations.   In many ways, San Antonio is a city that many people seem to underestimate. I showed up without high hopes, dreading the Texas heat and bad drivers. However, it\u2019s a place that I ended up finding some of my closest friends, along with a diverse community and thriving tech industry. Plus, it doesn\u2019t hurt that it\u2019s dubbed the Taco capital of the US.   \u2014  Joyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

Without hesitation, you rush there with glee to find that it is everything you could have hoped for! Wow! Data science saves the day!  This very relatable experience is a prime example of how many of us have experienced data science in our lives without realizing it. Let\u2019s take a quick moment to analyze how data science played the protagonist in this story. It is important to note that data science is a broad subject that encompasses a variety of things, including first gathering and shaping data, storing that data, then analyzing and visually presenting that data.  \u00a0 Before we can start analyzing data, Google data scientists must first be able to gather information about everything from restaurant locations, hours, pricing, customer reviews, etc. Next, this massive influx of data must be efficiently manipulated and organized so it can quickly be retrieved, Marie Kondo style. Data scientists are then able to take and analyze this data and visually translate it into something that makes sense, such as the graph that displays the busiest hours at the restaurant, or the tidy list of restaurants you see in the app that is ordered by distance from you.  A simple action such as filtering by \u201cOpen Now\u201d or \u201cPrice\u201d requires a tight coordination of all of these steps in order to actually produce the output expected by the user. Amazingly, Google Maps is able to do this analysis real-time to constantly change its results based on your current location. Not only that, it is simultaneously analyzing every single person\u2019s GPS data real-time. This allows them to generate components like the graph of how busy an establishment is at the moment. \u00a0 Another important factor in data science is using analysis to drive predictions (Read more here about the difference between data analytics and data science). For example, in calculating compatibility ratings, the program takes into account Google location history, search history, types of cuisine/restaurants you typically visit or avoid, whether you\u2019ve saved/rated/visited a place or somewhere similar, or simply data that a user inputs about their dietary preferences. It also allows for constant feedback from the user if a compatibility rating seems off, with a \u201cNot Right?\u201d link attached to every rating. In other words, this rating is a prediction of how much you would like a restaurant based on your past history and behavior.  So how exactly has Google mastered this compatibility rating? Most likely, data scientists at Google have created algorithms to take the pieces of information listed above to produce a prediction. Essentially, it\u2019s a way for a computer program to act more human. For example, think about how you recommend a show to your best friend. Most likely, you know your friend\u2019s personality and history of shows that they\u2019ve enjoyed, so you generally know what kind of show they may like watching.  Similarly, data scientists can use algorithms and statistical models to write code that continuously \u201clearns\u201d to make better predictions, creating an adaptable learning machine. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, Google is able to generate friendly human-like recommendations for over a billion people every single month, which is probably better than what your best friend could do.  As the data science field continues to progress and we get closer and closer to true artificial intelligence, we will most likely see the effects of that trickle down into the parts of our everyday life that we hardly consider. We already trust the algorithms and generated recommendations that suggest where or when to eat. Eventually, even something as vital as a life-altering surgery will be dictated by recommendations generated by algorithms for doctors. Understanding and learning about data science will become more significant as it gradually becomes enmeshed with society in ways we may not even be able to fully comprehend.

People commit to losing weight, learning new things, establishing new budgets \u2013 it\u2019s a time of action and hope. In this article, I\u2019d like to share a few ways that have helped me improve my coding and might give you some ideas to implement for 2019! \u201cGood seasons start with good beginnings.\u201d \u2013 Sparky Anderson Although the process of learning coding is a marathon and not a sprint, there\u2019s something to be said for short bursts of productivity like a 30-day challenge. For one, it may be an effective way to just get started on something you have been meaning to do for awhile, and as Mark Twain noted, \u201cHalf of getting ahead is getting started.\u201d On top of that, it gets rid of any excuses about \u201cnot having enough time\u201d. Because it\u2019s a short sprint, most people will begin prioritizing it differently. As different items on your daily to-do list begin to demand your time, you begin to prioritize the things that matter. Especially if you are a goal-oriented person, the satisfaction of completing a challenge like this may force you to prioritize it over other things. This may be the impetus you need to create lasting habits, ideally even after the challenge is over. However, over-enthusiastic participants may have to be wary of burnout or of a short-term \u201chigh\u201d. Make sure to use that momentum and keep on keeping on! If you Google \u201ccoding 30-day challenge\u201d, a multitude of options pop up. These challenges hypothetically can be done at any time, but doing it in January can be a powerful experience as you make a commitment to investing in yourself in 2019. Some popular coding challenges include the #Javascript30 by developer Wes Bos, the 30 day challenge at TechGig, and the 30 Days of Code by HackerRank. The first challenge is specific to Javascript, but the latter two challenges allow you to choose from a variety of languages to complete the challenges, so choose your best language and get coding! \u201cSuccess isn\u2019t always about greatness. It\u2019s about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. \u2013 Dwayne Johnson For those of you that are over the 30-day challenge hype, simply commit to coding every single day of 2019. If you\u2019re like me and have a bunch of grandiose life goals for yourself such as \u201cSpeak French fluently\u201d and \u201cBe able to program any full stack application\u201d, you may also have to be reminded that these grandiose goals can only be reached by consistently chipping away at it on a daily basis. It requires you to embrace mundanity and discipline. A neat life hack for making this goal a reality is finding a habit tracker such as HabitBull or Habitica. Both of these apps allow you to customize habits that you would like to form and track how often you complete those habits. Habitbull generates statistics and graphs for the frequency of completing certain habits, while Habitica promises to \u201cgamify your life\u201d. Although this option may no longer be available for purchase, take a look at Simone Giertz\u2019s Kickstarter for a 365 calendar here. This is a visual example of what completing a full year\u2019s worth of coding can look like. If you dedicate yourself to coding every single day, you may be surprised at how much progress you\u2019ve made by the end of the year. Even extremely successful individuals such as Josh Bosquez, the Senior Vice President of Engineering at my company, Armor, has shared that he still commits to coding every single day even if it\u2019s only one line. No matter what your coding experience level is, making it a priority to code every single day can only benefit your growth as a programmer.  No matter what, you\u2019ve got to always follow your passion in life and always keep learning. \u2013 Harold Hamm Technology is developing rapidly, and developers are constantly enhancing and creating frameworks and programming languages. For example, if you\u2019re even slightly involved in the coding community, you would probably know that for front-end frameworks, React and Vue have recently exploded in popularity. In order to stay relevant and continue to develop marketable skills, make an effort to stay up to date about news and trends in the programming world and keeping your skills sharp.  If you\u2019re just starting out with programming and feel that you have reached a plateau, many more experienced developers will recommend learning a second programming language to reiterate what you know and simultaneously enhance your understanding of programming on a deeper level. However, learning a new technology includes more than just learning a new programming language or framework. Explore what\u2019s interesting to you. Have you always wanted to look into artificial intelligence and machine learning? Or are you interested in the cloud and learning AWS? Or maybe you\u2019ve always wanted to learn more about developing mobile applications.  Commit to an actionable goal by either taking a course for a specific technology you want to learn or by studying and passing a certification. If you work for a company, it may be worth it to see if your manager agrees to help pay for additional learning or certifications.  The best way to learn is by doing. The only way to build a strong work ethic is getting your hands dirty. \u2013 Alex Spanos If you\u2019ve decided you want to learn a new technology, the above quote by Alex Spanos is the perfect way to gain that proficiency. This can be done on your own or with a group of friends for accountability. One specific resource I always like to recommend is Chingu. This international group of developers goes through \u201cVoyages\u201d, a process which encompasses project planning, developing, testing, and launching an application, specifically with the end goal of learning or practicing a new technology. Many of the participants are full-time software developers, but the collection of individuals is usually diverse. This organization is mostly focused on front-end technologies but they also have data science/design tracks in development. Check out their website for examples of previous projects teams have built and details on how to apply.  You\u2019re never too young or too old to be a mentor. \u2013 Reshma Saujani Even if you are just starting out, there are usually local organizations that need volunteers to mentor/facilitate learning for youth. In San Antonio I was hired part-time by Youth Code Jam, a non-profit that organizes and plans pop-up events and hosts summer camps in order to educate youth in topics related to technology. Currently, in Dallas, I volunteer with Bold Idea, a local organization that teaches kids to code, as well as facilitate a Girls Who Code group at a local library.  Although I don\u2019t consider myself yet to be a very experienced developer, seeking these leadership roles is more than just a resume builder. Because I have participated in these opportunities, I\u2019ve been able to expose myself to a wider variety of technologies such as block-level coding in Scratch, or creating Minecraft mods in Python. Additionally, it\u2019s a great way to network and meet people who are also interested in or work in the the technology field. Most large cities have similar local nonprofits or a chapter of a national organization such as Girls Who Code. If none exist, start one!  Every successful individual knows that his or her achievement depends on a community of persons working together. \u2013 Paul Ryan Although flying solo works for some, I have always found that having a tight knit community of motivated developers to consistently code with has always helped me grow. When I was participating in Codeup, some of us would form study groups or code together on projects after class at the local co-working space, Geekdom.  Although the community that is available at a bootcamp is not available to everyone, I would recommend searching Meetup.com for technology networking groups or programming specific get-togethers. Alternatively, make sure to check for a local chapter of FreeCodeCamp in your city. Other places to look include maker spaces and co-working spaces, both of which are communities that developers are typically drawn towards.  If both of those options come up empty, then start a group! Create a space for people to get together and work on their projects \u2013 invariably, you will draw like-minded people towards you.

During my four months at Codeup, I pursued what felt like an unattainable goal and actually reached it. When I tell people that I\u2019ve been coding less than a year and am now working as a software developer, people are usually impressed. But to be frank, I could never have done that without attending a coding boot camp like Codeup. It was a short four-month process that was like stumbling from a dusty, old wardrobe into Narnia: on one side, a clumsy and unenlightened beginner and thereafter being transformed by a completely new and fantastical world. Attending Codeup armed me with the experience and knowledge that allowed me to survive the harsh winter landscape that starting out from scratch as a software developer can be.  Now as I am working at my first real job, I\u2019m grateful to Codeup for teaching me several things that allowed me to be better prepared for my career. From beginning to end, Codeup placed a huge emphasis on group exercises. The beginning of the course was characterized by paired programming, a process in which one person is the navigator and one is the driver. As the names suggest, the navigator communicates with the person at the keyboard and directs them to type certain bits of code or navigate to specific elements on the page. Often, we would flip-flop between these roles so both students could get a crack at practicing one of two things: Firstly, we practiced how to communicate clearly and efficiently. Secondly, we learned how to take direction and ask clarifying questions.  At the time, I wasn\u2019t sure what the big deal was with paired programming and why the instructors at Codeup had made it such an integral part of the curriculum. However, as I go about my everyday duties at work, I realized how often I engage in informal bouts of paired programming. Although we have a Wikipedia-style knowledge base at my work where we document our processes, a lot of knowledge is still transferred orally (not ideal, but we\u2019re working on it!). What this means is that paired programming happens on a daily basis. If a developer is having a complex problem, it is usually easier for a coworker who has solved this problem before to sit down and walk them through it rather than try to explain things via chat or email. Towards the end of the semester, we coalesced into group projects in which the primary focus was teamwork. This was where we got a taste of working independently but in a team effort. It was during the group projects that I discovered the importance of learning how to use a versioning control system, such as GitHub, that allowed multiple developers to participate on the same project without stepping on any toes. When I started my job at Armor, I realized how much more complex versioning control can get when you have potentially 50+ people contributing to the same repository at any given time. I had to relearn the fundamentals and be extra careful not to overwrite someone else\u2019s work. Most mistakes are reversible, but the headache of figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it is usually a source of distraction from a developer\u2019s daily duties and sprint goals. When I initially started at Codeup, I found myself wanting to ask the instructors questions as soon as I got stuck on something. However, I quickly realized that their resources were limited since there were only 2 of them (plus 1-2 fellows) in a class of 30. Although this wasn\u2019t ideal, it actually did simulate a real-life scenario that parallels a professional working environment. At my work, there are probably only 2 or 3 lead developers. However, \u00a0they are constantly inundated with requests by QE and other junior developers, code review, and demands from management. If you need to make a request, best make it quick and efficient.  I then remembered what instructors had mentioned during Codeup. They taught us that if you have a question, make sure you present it in a format such as: This made it so that students would actually try to figure out a solution before shooting their hand up every time they had a problem, only to find that they could have easily solved it with a little more digging. In my experience, most experienced developers are usually happy to help. However, it\u2019s good practice to make sure to demonstrate you tried your best and that you\u2019re not wasting their precious time.  Throughout the boot camp, it came to be a running joke that everyone would have an emotional breakdown at least once during their time at Codeup. You would see someone walk off and come back with teary, red eyes. Or for some, they would vocalize their despair: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out for this.\u201d, \u201cThis is too hard.\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m so frustrated!\u201d, \u201cMaybe I should just give up.\u201d I myself broke down emotionally several times during Codeup and reiterated several mental self-doubts to myself: \u201cMaybe I should have stuck to the arts. I\u2019m too emotional to do well in computer science. I\u2019ll never be good enough\u201d. On some days, you would feel accomplished and confident in your abilities. On other days, the doubts would flood in unexpectedly and endanger everything I had worked so hard for. However, through the support of other students in the class, the instructors, and the encouragement of the staff, I was able to succeed throughout the course and completed my Demo Day project.  All this is to say, Codeup taught me to have emotional fortitude and a confidence to believe in myself. Because to be honest, the first several months at my job also felt like an emotional roller coaster. I was thrown into an environment where I had to learn and adapt very quickly. \u00a0I was constantly afraid and timid because I was the only female developer and also the most junior developer. I expected a lot out of myself, and when I was given criticism I would internally berate myself until my negative self-talk had multiplied the original piece of criticism in my mind ten-fold of what it actually was. However, my experience at Codeup had taught me to push through in those moments of self-doubt. It gave me a thicker skin in order to ask for help, to learn quickly amidst a ton of ambiguity, and most importantly, a realization that it will always get better as long as I don\u2019t give up As you might have noticed, none of the points above are actually related to the technical knowledge I received by attending Codeup and how it affected my career. It goes without saying that Codeup provided me with the coding skills I needed to be succeed in my career. However, another point that our instructors emphasized was that Codeup was not a comprehensive coding academy or computer science degree. In some ways, it was like a tour bus that allowed you a brief overview of all the major stops in the area.  It allowed us to have the impetus and catalytic energy to start off a software development career. It also gave us the tools to quickly be able to pick up any technologies our companies were using.  \u201cWe\u2019re teaching you how to learn,\u201d they would say throughout the course. After starting my first job, I came to realize how true this statement was. I imagined myself trying to pick up the technologies at my job without having Codeup as a primer and it seemed near impossible. Needless to say, Codeup was an essential experience I needed on the way to becoming a full-time software developer. I learned critical skills that have proved invaluable in my day-to-day and have allowed me to be where I am today. \u2014  \u00a0 Joyce is a full time software developer at Armor, a cloud security company in Richardson, TX.

Especially during this Thanksgiving season, I took the time to reflect even more deeply about the top three reasons I am grateful for Codeup. I am thankful for:  When they say that Codeup is a \u201ccareer accelerator,\u201d they are not joking! In just 18 weeks, you graduate with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the industry as a junior developer.  When I was first searching for options to learn how to code, I was told that any college degree program would take me two to four full-time years, or four or more part-time years, to finish. As we all know, our bills do not get put on hold while we are in school!  I also looked into free or inexpensive part-time programs so that I could continue to work full-time, and although I would describe myself as diligent and able to handle self-study, this would also have been a long route, and without the career advice and connections Codeup provides. Knowing what I know now, I am so glad I didn\u2019t try to study on my own. The depth of Codeup\u2019s curriculum, compared to some online training I have tried, is unmatched and very important to have in my current work as a developer. When you think about it, 18 weeks is a blip in your life, especially when that blip of time in Codeup very quickly produces a return on your investment. Remember to consider wages lost when making your decision: your time is VALUABLE, and time spent not in the workforce is wages lost that you could have been making. Speaking of finances, I am also thankful for\u2026 Did you know that many students receive internal scholarships and financial help from Codeup\u2019s funding partners? I, too, had sticker shock when I saw the price tag, but I ended up receiving Codeup\u2019s Women in Tech scholarship, as well as a grant from Project Quest, which greatly reduced my cost. For the remaining balance, I utilized one of Codeup\u2019s loan partners, which offers reduced payments while in school, and for two months after. Read more about my journey through Codeup here. Last but not least, I am thankful for\u2026 Until just a few years ago, I had never in my life met a computer programmer. I was not aware that this was a thriving career, or that development and IT jobs occupy many of the slots on Glassdoor\u2019s list of top careers. For several years, I was stuck in another field that was not for me, and I spent a lot of time thinking about how to get my foot in the door of this industry that seemed like it would better suit me and my needs. However, I did not have any connections in the industry or the direction needed to do this myself. Codeup provided access to the tech field to me, as a woman who knew nothing about code prior to attending, and as someone who constantly doubted (and still do sometimes) whether I would be able to grasp what I had heard was very difficult subject matter. They saw potential in my aptitude and, more importantly, in my attitude.  Life since Codeup has been incredible. My job is fun, challenging, and stimulating; most of the time, it feels like I\u2019m working on jigsaw puzzles all day. The hours just fly by, and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m getting paid for this! Sometimes, when that pesky ol\u2019 imposter syndrome pops up, a coworker of mine will brag about the quality or speed of my work to my supervisor, and I\u2019ll feel validated and appreciated all over again, despite my newness to the field. Financially, I also feel appreciated, as I am now a skilled worker in high demand. In fact, in less than a year since graduating from Codeup, I was able to purchase my first home, all by myself! This truly has been a life changing year. Codeup got me in the door of the tech industry, and where I go from here is up to me. This Thanksgiving, I am humbly grateful for finally being able to carve out my place in the world, and I hope the same for you. Happy Thanksgiving, y\u2019all! \u2014 Amy is very proud to say she is currently the only female developer employee working on Whataburger\u2019s first ever online ordering platform.

As a requirement for my Math degree, I took an Intro to Java class. I enjoyed it so much and was tempted to switch majors. However, I was a semester away from graduation and decided not to. Coding was still something I wanted to do so I tried some online courses.  The online classes were satisfactory, but it made me realize two things: 1) I didn\u2019t know what I needed to be learning and 2) whatever I did learn, I needed to be in a classroom setting to learn it. I heard about Codeup and other coding bootcamps and added myself to Codeup\u2019s mailing list. However, both the price and the thought of having to quit my job scared me from ever applying. I found a cheaper coding school and attended one of their coding workshops, but didn\u2019t like the way the workshop was run. The instructors only gave us lines of code to write with little theory behind it. That combined with poor organization in general made me realize that was not the place for me. I went back to Codeup\u2019s website and read about their curriculum. I liked how theory as well as practical usage was taught. I was also liked seeing how much help was available to students from instructors and student fellows. However, the biggest question still on my mind was, \u201cWill I get a job afterwards?\u201d I learned that the curriculum at Codeup is developed with input from tech companies, which means that Codeup is teaching important skills that employers are actually looking for. Incidentally, the curriculum changed a bit a few months before I started due to employers\u2019 requests. An added bonus on the job front was an in-house liaison between students and employers. Codeup\u2019s Director of Product, Stephen Salas, has connections with several companies and he always know which ones are looking for developers fresh out of school. I decided to take a chance and applied even though I was still worried about the financial part of it. When I got accepted, I found out that there are many scholarships and programs to help ease the financial burden. I qualified for some of these even though I thought I wouldn\u2019t. Many more scholarships and grants have been added since I left Codeup thus lowering the barrier to attend. I graduated in May 2018 and am currently working as a developer specializing in data extraction and transformation. I love what I\u2019m doing now. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t do this sooner.

With the start of this cohort, we launched a new blog series: the Codeup Student Check In. We\u2019ll interview a student over the course of their time with us to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 3! Check out Month 1 and Month 2. \u00a0 Codeup: How has your experience been at Codeup so far?  Wrangell Student: I\u2019ve had a great experience so far. Everything has been what I imagined and more. I have learned things in a short amount of time that otherwise would\u2019ve taken me months upon months to learn. The people here are some of the kindest and most supportive people that I\u2019ve met in a long time, and I\u2019m happy to have this experience in my life.  C: Describe what you\u2019re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging?  S: We\u2019ve just started our capstone project which is the final hurrah of our Codeup experience. We are in the planning stages and it\u2019s honestly a little overwhelming due to the sheer amount of information we\u2019re communicating to our teammates and because of the volume of work that\u2019s going to be done over this next week or two. Nonetheless, I am excited by the challenge and I know that our final project is going to be something that I will be really proud of and really happy to have been a part of. I\u2019m excited to see how it will all pan out.  C: How has the learning process/information gathering been? S: I love doing research and the focus of my research has shifted from solely academic to a balance between academic and professional. I am still researching new technologies as well as doing further research into the current curriculum but now I am also doing research into potential companies I\u2019d like to work with. I\u2019m interested in their mission and if their goals align with mine, both short and long term. C:What has been the most memorable part of this month? S:The most memorable part of this month has been actually shopping for new interview outfits, looking at myself in the mirror, and seeing a young professional. This has been one of my long-term goals and it\u2019s a great experience seeing it come to fruition. C:How do you feel your skill level compares to last month?  S: I think my skill levels are increasing each month. Now that we are going into full stack applications I can finally see the cumulative success of my time here. C: How have the instructors and staff been helpful? Have you started working with the placement side of Codeup? If so, can you elaborate on that?  S: I am grateful for the mock interview process with the instructors. It\u2019s really helpful to have your instructors grade you on your performance and prep you for real world interviews. These instructors all have some sort of practical experience and firsthand knowledge of the professional world. Their experience and advice is invaluable. C: Did you learn anything new at Codeup that you weren\u2019t expecting?  S: I wasn\u2019t expecting to learn as many people skills as I did. I thought this was strictly a technical school and this really came as a surprise. I have really learned how to network and how to talk to people that I otherwise would have been scared to talk to. I\u2019ve learned that people are people, just humans, and improving conversational skills to talk with them is valuable. Learning the value of a human connection in the professional world is a very exciting thing. C: Have you been interviewing for jobs? What has that been like? If not, do you know what type of role you are looking for? (Ie. Developer, Q/A, Tech sales, Tech Ed, etc) S: I\u2019ve had a few interviews this weekend and they have been very exciting and stressful. Having interviews back to back is both a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s important to destress at home and really be aware of your emotions and reactions to stress. Time management is another big challenge. How much time do I put into studying versus interview prep? How much time can I dedicate to other life roles and be a good girlfriend, good daughter, and good pet owner while still fulfilling my role as a student and job seeker? These challenges are tough to overcome, and this is where emotional awareness can really help. C: If you can give one piece of advice to any prospective students, what would it be?  S: Really do your research. Know what you\u2019re getting into. You can\u2019t go into anything blind! Get as much knowledge as you can so you can thoroughly prepare for and enjoy this journey. A great plan will save you a lot of suffering in the long run."}, {"title": "From Styling Hair to Stying Interfaces", "content": "By Sukari Schutzman I grew up loving technology. I still remember thinking that my grandmothers\u2019 flip phone in 1995 was the coolest thing I had ever seen. As a child, I took all my electronic toys apart, because I was curious what was inside. So you can say, I always yearned for a career in tech. My name is Sukari Schutzman. I don\u2019t take myself too seriously, I\u2019m always laughing, and trying to share positive energy, but most importantly I am a software developer. When I got my cosmetology license, I was passionate about doing hair. I wanted to learn how to be better, and how to perfect my craft. In many ways, I see a lot of parallels in cosmetology, and in software development. Drawing those parallels kept me strong in the program and reminded me to never give up. I remembered when I was in cosmetology school, or when I was in the salon and I was stuck on something, I always asked for help. In software development and at Codeup, the same rings true. I had always driven by the billboards on I-10 on my way into San Antonio and was ALWAYS confused. \u201cSoftware Developer? Why is \u2018Retail Manager\u2019 crossed out? What is that?\u201d, I always wondered. But I always continued to drive on and thought nothing of it when I reached my destination. I decided development was for me and wanted to transition into it and learn how to code, as I had been exposed to it for a while. I knew self-study would not work for me. I needed to be in a classroom and knew I needed to be in front of an instructor. But most importantly, I needed a job ASAP because I needed to support myself and my child. When I arrived at Codeup and went on the tour I was amazed. I knew this would be the place for me, and it was going to be where I knew my life would change. I was going to be walking out of one door and into another. And I wasn\u2019t going to look back.\n When I found out that I had got in, I was so happy that my hard work paid off and I knew it was just the beginning of what was to come. I looked forward to the start date and marked it on my calendar. I also quit my job, which was much needed because salon life was stressful enough, let alone learning a new skill. The next few months were filled with triumphs and failures, which is normal in any career. No one is born good at everything, it takes practice and determination (I totally had to repeat that to myself every single day at Codeup. Thanks Ryan!). Sometimes it felt like two steps back, but I was determined to make it to Demo Day and present my Capstone. With the help of Codeup staff, I felt set up to succeed at Demo Day. But most of all, I felt prepared for my new career. Demo Day finally came! Our project got the most compliments on the visual interface, which I worked hard on, and helped us stand out amongst our classmates. I had a few interviews set up for within a week after Demo Day and landed my first job. At this point, I was in awe. Everything I worked hard for had finally came to fruition. And most of all, I didn\u2019t have to work weekends unless I wanted to. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being a hairstylist, absolutely not! However, it just wasn\u2019t for me anymore. Thanks to Codeup, my life is so different now. And for that, I am eternally grateful."}, {"title": "From Cooking Steaks To Cooking Code", "content": "by Alexander Bous  Growing up It would be an understatement to say that the bar of expectations were set high as the youngest of 4 to immigrant parents, who were also mechanical engineers. Eldest: Entrepreneur with several successful businesses; Second: Contract Law Lawyer; Third: Doctor of Neonatal Genetics; Fourth (Me): cooked since I was 15. Although the decision to make a career of cooking didn\u2019t hit me for a few years, I had known that I did not want to follow the footsteps of my parents or siblings. Cooking At the age of 19, I decided that I wanted to attend college at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America (CIA). Before I could finalize my decision, I knew I had to tell my parents. They reacted just as I thought they would. \u201cWhat?! NO, NEVER! Never in my life did I ever think my son would become a cook.\u201d Our family comes from a culture where there are three acceptable career paths: Doctors, Lawyers, and Engineers. Coming from a family where I already had a sibling fulfilling each of those roles, I felt that I had nothing to prove to anyone except myself. I ended up attending CIA and working in the industry for 15 years. Having held every role in a kitchen and marriage, including being a parent, I decided it was time to put my ego aside, think about what\u2019s best for my family, and transition careers. The Most Important Thing Early on in my cooking career, I had a mentor that drilled a simple phrase into my head: \u201cThe most important thing in life is to figure out what is most important.\u201d This simple saying spoke very loudly to me; how can you work towards a goal if you don\u2019t know what the goal is? Every task I would work on in life would ring those words in my head; So what was most important to me? \u201cA happy family and nothing else\u201d is what I have defined as what is most important. Now it\u2019s time to figure out how to get there. The First Step: Codeup Open House After spending too much time on autopilot, it was then that I realized the only thing keeping me in the restaurant industry was that it was the only thing I really knew. I needed to break the mold to be able to achieve the most important thing. Having always been computer savvy and a self-proclaimed problem solver, I soon realized that I was better with computers than I thought. It seemed to come more naturally to me than others, which was when I realized I needed to find a career that would allow me to use my skills in computers. There was only one clear answer for me, and that was Codeup. I spent time at their open house, and I was sold. Not only were they kind and caring individuals, but also extremely smart and talented developers and teachers. It seemed like the right answer. The Second Step: \u201cGood\u201d After getting through the admissions process and getting accepted, I decided to make the best of my decision to attend and set a plan of action to take in as much as possible. I made note cards, studied ahead, built random projects I found online, and ran code kata\u2019s everyday. Sounds impressive, but I can assure you, there was much failure involved. If I was struggling, \u201cGood\u201d would tend to be my response because with failure comes the opportunity to get better; it meant that there was something that I needed to work on. As the difficulty level strengthened, so did the number of \u201cGood\u201d moments. There were moments when doubt and worry went through my mind as well. I was worried that I had made the wrong move. \u00a0I turned to my classmates with the plea for help, they responded similarly as well. \u201cWhat a relief,\u201d I thought. It was good to know that I wasn\u2019t the only one in class struggling because it made me realized I tricked myself into thinking that I was couldn\u2019t do it.  Finding a Job with Only Cooking Experience After graduating from Codeup and being fully aware of my imposter syndrome, I could not shake the thought of why someone would hire me. I would have to constantly remind myself that, with the skills I had from my previous work experiences and the new skills I learned over the past 18 weeks, I was more than capable. With the help of the Director of Product, Stephen Salas, I was able to find a job within one week of graduating. Goal Achieved: Now What? Maintain and Gain Skills I got the knowledge, got the job, and got the work/life balance. Now what? Now it\u2019s time to continue to learn and advance with your newly learned skills. One thing I realized after going through the Codeup program was that there are a lot of similarities between learning to code and learning to cook. At first, basic skills require a lot of effort and struggle, but eventually they become second nature. After the basics are understood and the muscle memory is built, then comes the never ending list of more advanced skills. When people ask me what the best part of Codeup is, I tend to respond simply with, \u201cthey taught me how to learn\u201d. I look at new projects that I am given and when I have no idea where to start, I say \u201cGood\u201d, another opportunity to get better. [rev_slider alias=\u201dfooter\u201d][/rev_slider]"}, {"title": "Data Science Myths", "content": "By Dimitri Antoniou and Maggie Giust Data Science, Big Data, Machine Learning, NLP, Neural Networks\u2026these buzzwords have rapidly spread into mainstream use over the last few years. Unfortunately, definitions are varied and sources of truth are limited. Data Scientists are in fact not magical unicorn wizards who can snap their fingers and turn a business around! Today, we\u2019ll take a cue from our favorite Mythbusters to tackle some common myths and misconceptions in the field of Data Science. \u00a0 Myth #1: Data Science = Statistics At first glance, this one doesn\u2019t sound unreasonable. Statistics is defined as, \u201cA branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data.\u201d That sounds a lot like our definition of Data Science: a method of drawing actionable intelligence from data.  In truth, statistics is actually one small piece of Data Science. As our Senior Data Scientist puts it, \u201cStatistics forces us to make assumptions about the nature of the relationship between variables, the distribution of the data, etc.\u201d In the traditional Data Science venn diagram, you\u2019ll see that math/stats make up \u2153 of a working professional. These are tools and skills to leverage, but data science itself is about drawing intelligence from data. BUSTED\n via GIPHY \u00a0 Myth #2: Data Scientist = Business/Data Analyst This one is so common that we wrote a whole post about it! These are separate and different roles within the data field. While a data scientist will often do analytics, their spectrum of work is wider. A data analyst will use structured data to create dashboards and KPIs, while a Data Scientist deals with unstructured and messy data for a range of outputs. If they\u2019re interested, business analysts will often progress to data scientists. BUSTED  via GIPHY \u00a0 Myth #3: Data Science = Data Science This one\u2019s tricky, because it\u2019s impossible to either confirm or bust! The \u2018myth\u2019 is that one person or company using the term Data Science is not necessarily the same as another person or company using the same term. Depending on organizational capacity, individual experience, educational background, and many other variables, we might be using the same name for different animals. Tl;dr: don\u2019t assume a common understanding across hiring managers, recruiters, and practitioners. Look instead for specifics of tools, techniques, methodologies, and outputs. That being said, this one falls in the \u201cplausible\u201d category, because it may actually be true in some circumstances, while false in others. PLAUSIBLE  via GIPHY \u00a0 Myth #4: Data Science curricula are well-defined and consistent. We recommend checking this one out for yourself! A quick google search for bootcamps, master\u2019s degree programs, and online courses will reveal that different organizations teach different things. There is no commonly accepted framework for teaching data science! Some focus more on the engineering, others focus more on machine learning, some think deep learning is foundational, and some prefer to use R.  Our curriculum was built through employer interviews, practitioner interviews, market research, and company partnerships. But we\u2019re based in Texas! A bootcamp in New York might follow the same process and end up with a different syllabus. Keep in mind, whatever your learning path, that there will be gaps in your learning. The most important thing is to recognize those gaps. BUSTED  via GIPHY \u00a0 Myth #5: If I want to be a data scientist, I just need to learn Python or R. This one is common and dangerous! Just like statistics, programming languages like Python and R are tools. They\u2019re just pieces of a larger puzzle! Knowing Python without understanding the data science pipeline is like knowing how to build a floor without having a floor plan. Of course, these are valuable technical skills that give you a leg up, but they\u2019re second in importance to asking the right questions, knowing what tools to use when, and communicating your findings.

When I first started as a developer I ran into some scary scenarios. My code was very error prone and I created some functions that I was expecting a string as the output but I got an object. It was very frustrating and I wasn\u2019t even sure I would be able to understand software development let alone have to go and fix my code. My nightmare scenario was to be hired on as a developer and then have to troubleshoot, a.k.a. debug, some other developers code\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31. I think most junior developers have had shared my fear at some point in their career. I was taught to heavily rely upon outputting your results to the console whether its good or bad to help troubleshoot. In this post I will do my best to help calm the fears of my fellow junior developers with helpful debugging tools and hopefully transition away from relying upon\u00a0console.log(). While my focus will be on JavaScript these tools can easily be translated to other languages. For the longest time\u00a0console.log()\u00a0was my go-to when I needed to debug JavaScript code. It was my developer friend who told me what was wrong with my code and was never judgemental\u00a0. I will admit that there are few scenarios where it is \u201cOK\u201d to output the results of a function to the console. Except more recently, I have found using\u00a0console.log()\u00a0to be less useful when debugging\u00a0and only making things worse by expecting a good outcome and then disappointing me. Like an expired $5 Amazon Gift Card (Thanks, grandma). Take for example, this gem: That lovely error is from IE 11 which does not support Array.from(node List) prototype without a shim/poly fill that is available\u00a0here. However, I have come to find out that logging errors to the console is either inefficient or completely irrelevant to what may actually be causing the problem in your code. I will admit that some errors are easily resolved by reading the output of the error message and fixing the typo or following the instructions of the error message to help resolve the problem. So in the image above we are shown a node item which has so many properties that you might not be aware of, which renders console.log useless. You have to know ahead of time what value or specific attribute you are trying to output which requires some abstract thinking or referencing documentation to identify this property. Now using the console.log will output all the entire properties of the node item but its an unnecessary step to add in this line of code while you debug and then go back and remove the line of code. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know\u201d -Bill Parcel (Head Coach New England Patriots) The error the console outputs might provide you with the location of the error, but you may not know why are you getting the error in the first place. Maybe you\u2019re passing the incorrect value to the function or you are working with event handling and\u00a0bubbling events. Either way, chances are that you aren\u2019t thinking about that one property that is actually passing the value your expecting because you weren\u2019t aware of how to call it or pass it along. I\u2019m going to piggy back off of\u00a0Mozilla\u2019s Debug Playground\u00a0as an example for why you shouldn\u2019t use the console and instead use the Browsers built-in debugger or equally as helpful is an IDE\u2019s built-in debugger. cough cough\u00a0Visual Studio Code\u00a0cough cough \u00a0Now, whether you prefer Chrome over FireFox is a whole different can-o-worms. \u201cHey man, I\u2019m a back-end developer and so I need to console.log\u201d -Fictional Backend Developer So maybe you don\u2019t have a fully fleshed out web form or you\u2019re trying to get data from some API or JSON file. You need to see data from the function you\u2019re writing or better yet you want to test a function that someone else wrote without having to clone the entire project. Using\u00a0console.log()\u00a0seems like the go to. In fact,\u00a0around \u00be of Node.js developers report using it\u00a0(in 2017) for finding errors in their applications. I\u2019m here to tell you of a few better ways to debug your code. The first tool I have come to love and trust is one made by a company called\u00a0Wallaby.js QuokkaJS (Integrated Scratchpad for JavaScript) With this plug-in you can write your code and get immediate results. No need to throw in a bunch of console.log\u2019s in your function and check the output. It has an integration for\u00a0VSCode\u00a0(\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 ),\u00a0JetBrainsIDE\u00a0and\u00a0Atom. I personally have purchased a pro license but for the most part the community version will work just fine. SonarLint\u00a0( Like spellcheck but for your code) I think all developers should have some sort of code linting tool added into their IDE. This helps review your code in real-time and \u201cshould\u201d prevent you from compiling or running code with errors in it. I\u2019ve chosen SonarLint because its given me better results than ES6 linter or some other linting tools that i\u2019ve tried. I\u2019m not saying its the best or that the others don\u2019t work but I haven\u2019t had to configure much other than just installing the extension. Scratchpad (Built-in Browser Javascript sandbox) Mozilla also offers a feature in their\u00a0DevTools\u00a0that allows you to write, run, and view the output of JavaScript code that can interact with the current web page or not. I have a background in\u00a0.NET development and I have fallen in love with\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s F# Language\u00a0along with the\u00a0fsharp community. While going through the documentation I was introduced to a new term, REPL. REPL stands for:\u00a0Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop. \u201c In a REPL, the user enters one or more expressions (rather than an entire\u00a0compilation unit) and the REPL evaluates them and displays the results.\u201d -Wikipedia So I thought, this was cool and I used my Googliness\u2122\ufe0f to search for an online version or service and so I came upon THIS. REPL.IT  I don\u2019t need to console.log my output or assign the function to\u00a0var result = greeting()\u00a0and then\u00a0console.log(greeting(\"Jessica\"))\u00a0. I just write my function, invoke it and BOOM! I get the output without the need of\u00a0console.log()\u00a0. Repl.it supports many languages!  I can even create a Repl, write some code and share the link with someone that can give me feedback, Brilliant! Coincidentally, Repl.it uses\u00a0Monaco, which is the same Editor that VSCode uses. Finally, for the developer on a budget (including myself) most popular IDEs have a built-in debugger that works the same was as the debugger in Chrome or Firefox. I\u2019ve kindly added links to How-Tos: For a few IDEs (don\u2019t get mad if your IDE is not listed, I\u2019m looking at you Atom IDE community). Debugging in VSCode\u00a0 Debugging in JetBrains IntelliJ Debugging in Visual Studio Final Thoughts So why have I gone through the long winded trouble of explaining / trying to convince you why you should wean yourself off of using the console.log and embrace debugging tools? How was this suppose to make you feel better / more confident in writing code? The short answer is:\u00a0I believe having more information and proper tools \u201cshould\u201d make coding, and for that matter debugging, less daunting / scary. Use of widely available, open-source debugging tools is key to be more familiar with software development and to grow as a developer.

What\u2019s the difference from data analytics? Which type of program is right for me? If you\u2019re interested in becoming a data scientist, you might be wondering how other people got into the field. Given how new the profession is, most of today\u2019s practitioners probably didn\u2019t study data science formally as undergraduate or graduate students. So today we\u2019re asking: where do data scientists come from? Let\u2019s start broadly by defining the possible pathways into this career. If you\u2019re a Data Scientist, you probably followed one or more of these paths: Each of these pathways has unique advantages and disadvantages across variables like cost, formal credential, length, and pace. A free online program is free and accessible, but takes a lot of dedication to follow through and is harder to change careers with. A bootcamp specializes in quick and efficient job outcomes, but is a big investment. A university offers a formal degree and dives deeper, but is more expensive and takes longer.  Each of these pathways also leaves gaps against the complete picture of a data scientist. From your training you might be missing components like: working with real data sets, understanding industry and company demands, using up-to-date technologies, or even just knowing what you don\u2019t know! What\u2019s important to understand here is that different pathways yield strengths and gaps. Your job is to find, acknowledge, and improve your gap areas! Now that we have a framework for understanding potential pathways, let\u2019s look at some data. In preparing to launch Codeup\u2019s immersive Data Science program, we researched over 250 data scientist profiles on LinkedIn and analyzed their educational and career histories. Here\u2019s what we found! 95% have a Bachelor\u2019s Degree, 70% have a Master\u2019s Degree, and 27% have a PhD. Of those degrees, the most represented areas of study are: math, stats, business, engineering, and CS. Data Scientists come from an incredibly diverse range of professional backgrounds: psychology research, software development, business analyst, mechanical engineering, and more! We saw a few prominent patterns in our data:  A third component of our research was to interview practicing Data Scientists. We asked questions like: What was your path to the field? What did you study? Is there a need for programs like Codeup? What are the most important skills to learn? After conducting these interviews, we had three valuable lenses to understand the paths into Data Science: educational histories, career histories, and first-hand qualitative research. From these three, we compiled 5 archetypal Data Scientist personas! \u00a0  If you see yourself in any of this research, you might be on the path to becoming a Data Scientist! Still have questions?

With our first-class kicking off in February and only 25 seats available, we\u2019ve been answering a lot of questions from prospective students. One, in particular, has come up so many times we decided to dedicate a blog post to it. What is the difference between data science and data analytics? First, let\u2019s define some of our terms! Take a look at this blog to understand what Data Science is. In short, it is a method of turning raw data into action, leading to the desired outcome. Big Data refers to data sets that are large and complex, usually exceeding the capacity of computers and normal processing power to deal with. Machine Learning is the process of \u2018learning\u2019 underlying patterns of data in order to automate the extraction of intelligence from that data. \u00a0 \u00a0 Now, let\u2019s look at the data pipeline that data scientists work through to reach the actionable insights and outcomes we mentioned: Data professionals work at different stages of the spectrum to move data through the pipeline. On the left, Big Data Engineers specialize in collecting, storing, and processing data, getting it from Data to Information. In the middle, analysts work to understand and convert that information to knowledge. Lastly, a Machine Learning Engineer utilizes machine learning algorithms to turn intelligence into action by building automations, visualizations, recommendations, and predictions. Data Scientists span multiple stages of this pipeline, from information to action. They will spend about 70% of their time wrangling data in the information stage. They will conduct a statistical analysis to derive knowledge. Lastly, they predict future events and build automations using machine learning. For those technical folk out there, data science is to data engineering or machine learning engineering as full-stack development is to front-end or back-end development. For the non-technical folk, data science is the umbrella term that houses data analytics, machine learning, and other data professions. So what\u2019s the biggest difference between a data analyst and a data scientist? Data scientists utilize computer programming and machine learning in addition to mathematics and statistics.

Each student had a duck at their seat on the first day of our 18 \u00bd week advanced full stack web development boot camp. The expression of each duck varied, but they all stared quietly and blankly at us as we took in our surroundings with excitement and anticipation. At the time, I had no idea what it was for or why we needed that bath time friend. Now I do. Part of what I love about programming is the problem-solving. However, in the attempt to figure out a software solution the developer very often can get tunnel vision \u2013 stuck on solving a problem the same wrong way or just get stumped with no real direction. This is where rubber duck debugging is the most useful. It originated from a book called \u201cThe Pragmatic Programmer\u201d by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. Rubber duck debugging is simple. It includes taking the problem you are trying to solve and explaining it out loud to the rubber duck. This may seem silly because most of us have not talked to inanimate objects since we were kids. However, by doing this it forces a developer to think in a different way and to look at an issue under a microscope. Talking out loud activates a different part of the human brain, which very often helps the developer solve a problem without ever talking to another person. It keeps us from wasting our own time and the time of others when the solution is right at our fingertips. I have experienced this phenomenon myself when I try to explain aspects of programming to people who are not programmers. It forces me to think of programming in a different way. I have to lose the acronyms, and just speak plain English to a person who isn\u2019t such an avid techie like myself. When I do that I walk away with new knowledge and a refreshed passion for what I have been discussing. I also learned later that the rubber duck is the official mascot for Codeup. His name is Codey and he has a special meaning to me beyond just rubber duck debugging. I began to sketch him on the first day of class. Over time he began to express my struggles and triumphs while learning to code. He came alive for me and became a student of Codeup alongside me during my time there. If I had a bad day, he totally understood because he was in the fire with me. If I struggled to understand a concept, he got that too and listened while I talked to him about what I was trying to do. Now, as a proud graduate of Codeup working as a software developer at a fantastic company, I keep Codey with me. He is in my car and at my desk at work. He also sits on my desk at home \u2013 waiting patiently to hear my struggles and what I am trying to solve for that day. If you do not have a rubber duck for debugging, I suggest you go out and get one!"}, {"title": "From the Service Industry to Software Development", "content": "By Randi Mays  For many teenagers, the path to self-reliance starts in one of two places: a restaurant or retail store. Until it\u2019s time to begin a professional career, you\u2019re working that part-time job stocking shelves, helping irate customers with expired coupons or prepping for the dinner rush. I\u2019d venture to say I\u2019m one of the very few who was sad to leave that lifestyle behind. I worked in the food service and retail industries for 10 years before I attended Codeup. I took great pride in my work every day; I couldn\u2019t go home until everything was near perfect: my work area spotless, the shelves neatly stocked and everything ready for the next shift. When it came time to leave the service industry and move on to professional work, I was initially reluctant. I had found great personal fulfillment and success in customer service. Why would I want to leave?  I have big dreams. Of course I want to travel the world, spending my vacations in exotic destinations, trying new foods, seeing centuries-old architecture, and making lasting memories. But more importantly, I wanted to work for a company with a more widespread mission than gastronomic satisfaction. I wanted to work alongside people with a passion for their work that ran far deeper than a paycheck. After graduating from Codeup in September 2016, I began working for USAA as a software developer and I can tell you\u2013the company is no stranger to giving. Each employee receives company paid volunteer hours and I used some of mine to volunteer at the San Antonio Food Bank among dozens of other USAA employees. Last year when Hurricane Harvey hit, USAA was quick to organize several volunteer sessions at their home campus to prepare food and other basic necessities to be delivered to people in need. They even have a system where I can automatically deduct a specified amount from my paycheck to give to charitable causes I am passionate about. I have heard story after story about their representatives on the phone going above and beyond their duties to serve members in combat zones and at home. I can\u2019t enumerate here all of the reasons I admire USAA for its community involvement and caring, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve made my point. There are times I look back on my experience in food service and retail nostalgically, remembering how I excelled in those positions and enjoyed the repetitive work. Then I come back to the present and remember how big an impact my employer makes serving the military community and their families, and how many lives are changed by the work I do with my team. I find great personal satisfaction and pride in my work every day, and I am just getting started."}, {"title": "Codeup Student Check In: Month 2", "content": "Codeup welcomed our newest cohort, the Wrangell cohort, on July 23. With the start of this cohort, we are launching a new blog series: the Codeup Student Check In. We\u2019ll interview a student over the course of their time with us to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 2! Check out Month 1 and Month 3. We took the time to sit down with our Wrangell student to see how they\u2019ve been doing so far! Codeup: Describe what you\u2019re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging?  Wrangell Student: In this section of the curriculum we are learning about the basics of Java and the building blocks that make up the language. This language is more verbose than previous material, and one of the hardest parts is understanding the instructions and translating them to code.  C: How has the learning process/information gathering been? S: A wide variety of resources are available. In addition to the curriculum, I utilize the Head First Java book and the Oracle documentation. Another challenge is combining the knowledge from all these resources into one. C: How do you feel your skill level compares to last month?  S: Comparing my skill level now with that of last month is no contest. Everyone around me is improving as well and I am excited to see my classmates skill levels growing. Our skills are improving exponentially! C: How have the instructors and staff been helpful? S: The instructors hold study hall before class and after to give us extra help. They\u2019re constantly posting resources in our slack channel and encouraging us to ask questions. They have no problem going back to review material or clarify any questions we have. At the same time, they encourage our learning. They don\u2019t give us the answer if it\u2019s obvious or an easily searchable question. C: Share a fun experience you had at Codeup! Our great staff gave us some very cool thermoses. I\u2019m a diehard sticker fan. I immediately ordered coding and anime related stickers for this thermos and they\u2019re going straight on the thermos the moment they come in! C: What has been the most memorable part of this month and has anything exciting happened? S: Codeup expanded onto the 6th floor of the Vogue building, so we\u2019re coding in a totally different environment. It\u2019s full of natural light, which makes me very happy. I personally love heights so it\u2019s great to look out the windows while taking a break from coding. Something exciting that happened was that I got my first star! Instructors give us stars for asking good questions. I\u2019m the type of person who needs to google the answer first before asking something. I wouldn\u2019t want to ask something that is easily available on the internet. However, Java is very challenging, and I just needed to ask questions and I got a star!

First, we recommend understanding what data science is\u00a0and what\u00a0full-stack web development is. Second, ask yourself the following three questions: One key difference between our programs is the prerequisite background knowledge. Our\u00a0web development program\u00a0doesn\u2019t have any required skills! Some students enter with no tech experience, and others enter with a lot. Having programming experience is always a plus, but not a must. However, Data Science relies on experience in math, statistics, and basic programming for all incoming students. You\u2019ll need concepts like working with matrices, writing Python functions, and solving systems of equations. That means that you either need coursework in those subjects, self-teaching experience, or on the job training. Your answer to this question isn\u2019t a simple yes/no, but it should help you determine the ramp-up period to one of our programs and which one fits you better now.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have any math or programming background, web development may be a better fit. If you have a Math or CS degree, data science may be. Do numbers get you hyped up? Do you love or hate excel? Do you really like programming? Do massive data sets feel intimidating or exciting? Do you enjoy statistics and math? Do you like being visually creative? Do you want to build web applications? Do you want to focus just on technical work or mix technical and business work? This list isn\u2019t exhaustive, but it should kickstart your thinking to explore your intrinsic interest in the content of our programs. Try to understand what each profession does day-to-day, and then ask yourself: which gets me more excited?

You\u2019re in great shape either way, but you\u2019ll be much happier with the content that makes you happy. When you graduate from Codeup, we\u2019ll help you land your first job. From the Web Development program, that likely means a job as a software developer, web developer, or programmer. From the Data Science program, that likely means a job as a data scientist, data engineer, or machine learning engineer. But that\u2019s just the first job! As you move through your tech career, you\u2019ll discover new interests and opportunities, like the following. Web Development:\u00a0web developer (alternative titles: web designer, UI/UX designer, front-end developer, front-end engineer, full-stack developer, software developer), programming, quality assurance technician, technical sales, product/project manager, etc. Data Science:\u00a0data scientist, analysts of all kinds (data, business, risk, fraud, marketing, web, competitive), customer intelligence, business intelligence, data engineer, dashboard/data visualization developer, machine learning engineer, etc. You now know what data science and full-stack web development are.

Starting my computing career at Trinity University has proven to be extremely important; all the hours spent on algorithm design, data structures, logic are all essential in what I\u2019m doing now. However, it is not an uncommon idea that what colleges teach can sometimes be an offset to industry demands. I experienced this significant gap between employer expectations and my computing skill-set post-college, and with the\u00a0I-need-a-job-to-get-experience-to-work-for-a-job-that-requires-experience\u00a0catch that most college graduates experience the first few years of leaving academia, I found myself struggling to find employment. The first year of leaving my university was a humbling yet soul-crushing experience. Why is it that I\u2019ve pursued a degree directly related to such a hungry market for software developers, but I am unable to find a job? Among what seemed like an endless stream of interviews in which I partook, I began to notice a trend \u2013 I lacked full-stack development experience with relevant programming languages that are currently in demand. Turns out, having theoretical knowledge isn\u2019t enough for most employers in the market. The industry of software development has evolved throughout the years of its existence, and with its evolution came new programming languages that better suit the needs of its users and the customers it will eventually serve. Ultimately, logical thinking did not trump most self-taught HTML, CSS, Javascript developers that fill the market with highly innovative ideas and projects. As a Trinity graduate who still lived in San Antonio after graduating, I learned more about Codeup from peers who contributed to the curriculum and program\u2019s growth. Some of my classmates in my department also attended the program and found great opportunities within the industry upon graduating from the program. At first, I was skeptical of the value Codeup could bring to someone like me who already had experience in programming, albeit in languages that weren\u2019t exactly in demand. But, being unemployed and discouraged for seemingly an eternity, I decided to give it a go.\n The program was an introduction to programming, which is very different from my experience in college. Since I was verbose in the structure and characteristics of software development, it was easily digestible. The curriculum consisted of introductions to different programming languages, and most importantly, showed me how everything pieced together to form working and aesthetically pleasing products that definitely had the potential to be client-facing projects that serve the public. It was an eye-opening experience for me: seeing and experiencing web development with relevant technologies like MVC, ES6, and the Spring Framework. As most of the course material was quickly grasped by my existing mode of thinking, I spent most of my time on the assignments, perfecting them and pushing myself to create difficult effects or programs. The instructors were all extremely helpful and understanding of my background, and were even nice enough to provide me with bonus assignments to push what I\u2019ve learned to its limits. I never would have guessed that Codeup would benefit me in the way it did. Within a week of graduating, I found a job as a Salesforce Developer at a consulting company here in San Antonio. Together with the knowledge I\u2019ve obtained from my degree, I have put everything I learned at Codeup to use: creating real products used by thousands of real users. I wouldn\u2019t be here without the experience I had, not just with the curriculum, but with the excellent career placement staff at Codeup. As clich\u00e9 as it may sound, the benefits I\u2019ve gotten from the program that acted as supplements to my degree don\u2019t fall far from being life-changing, and I would encourage those who have experienced the same struggles as me in this competitive market to give it a go."}, {"title": "5 Things Codeup Doesn\u2019t Tell You", "content": "I remember during my first day of Codeup I began to doubt my ability to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.\u00a0I soon learned that what I was experiencing was \u201cimpostor syndrome.\u201d Jason Straughan, Codeup\u2019s CEO, introduced us to this phenomenon that same day. Thanks to his kind advice I was able to identify, and overcome my doubts.\u00a0Codeup shared many valuable lessons with me, but some lessons were taught through exposure outside of the Vogue building. If you decide to enroll at Codeup, you will find yourself learning many things outside the classroom.\u00a0I realized through my own journey that there are things Codeup didn\u2019t tell me. So, I\u2019ve narrowed it down to the 5 main things I had to learn on my own as a newly placed software developer. You Need to be Multilingual  You need to be adaptable and willing to open your ears to all ideas. They say the best way to learn a different language is through practice. In most of our professional and non-professional lives, relationships will have an assigned lingo to properly cater to that relationship. Furthermore, professional groups and organizations like projectQUEST, H-E-B, and Codeup have their own kind of language. These languages are used to identify and recognize individuals of that group or organization. It is important to keep this in mind before you start ANY application process, or start working with new people. Even though I did not have a college degree, I still had an interest in developing coding skills. I understood early on in my application process that I was in control of my outcome. I assumed determination contained the key to my success, and soon found myself being referred to ProjectQUEST for financial assistance.I would have never known about ProjectQUEST if the Codeup staff had not offered this vital information. The dedication and support offered by these organizations helped me through the multiple application processes. If you plan to visit projectQUEST or Workforce Solutions to inquire about their grants, make sure you\u2019re determined to learn their language, and earn the money. If you have the right amount of determination you can find the proper channels fueling San Antonio\u2019s STEM ecosystem through a simple Google search. Determination is one of the common denominators all Codeup graduates share, and if you too share this similarity, check out the\u00a0scholarships\u00a0offered by Codeup. People want jobs, but not everyone wants to work.  via GIPHY Codeup\u2019s mission statement is the following, \u201cAt Codeup, we focus on two things: you and your success. Find a job within six months of graduation,\u00a0or get 50% of your tuition returned.\u201d Let me assure you they deliver in service, \u00a0content, and in career guidance. However, the staff cannot force you to either study the curriculum or develop programming skills for you. There are people that come ready to overcome adversity, then there are the few who expect to be fed morning tacos with a silver spoon. If you\u2019re seriously considering Codeup, you need to prepare yourself to manage the beautiful chaos of assignments, interviews, and presentations. My high school soccer coach had a saying, \u201cDo you think Ronaldo is going to parachute from a helicopter and score for you?\u201d We never expected Ronaldo at our high school practices but that was our coach handing down some of his kind wisdom. He used this as a tactic to build the team up before the start of our shooting drills. Ronaldo is a world star player who plays at a professional level so what coach Ramos was really trying to say was, \u201cWork hard if you want the goal. Don\u2019t expect someone to come and score for you!\u201d You need to have a sense of responsibility before embarking on your own journey and launching your career. Have a servant\u2019s heart. Some lessons weren\u2019t coming from a screen or projector and I considered these some of my favorite lessons because they spoke more about human character. A perfect example is when the Codeup staff noticed a need in our community and decided to share their passion for service with all San Antonians. The office staff\u00a0volunteered to serve\u00a0at the San Antonio Food Bank. This was one of the unspoken teachings Codeup shared with me \u2013 these amazing individuals create an environment where you can grow in skill and as a human being. Kudos to them! I will iterate once again that Codeup will not force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do. As a newly placed member of this ecosystem and a Codeup graduate I would like to ask Codeup fellows and members of the community to ponder, \u201cHow are we contributing to the San Antonio ecosystem?\u201d Having the heart of a servant is something Codeup can\u2019t force you to do, but is a skill necessary to achieve self growth and development. Don\u2019t eat the tacos!  via GIPHY Codeup is geared to focus on your professional life, and not your waistline. The Codeup family loves to spoil the cohorts with food, they must know the way to a developer\u2019s heart. The morning tacos, the pizza, and snacks should be enough to lure you into the Vogue building. I loved every bite and sip of these delicious perks. However I do have to confess I gained a few pounds during my time at Codeup. I was also on a budget so the ramen noodle isle at the Walgreens became very familiar. Now that I look back I wish I only had one slice of pizza instead of my usual three. One of the hardest parts of my Codeup journey was finding time to exercise. Taking care of myself felt impossible in this intense immersive environment, but believe me when I say \u201cIt is possible!\u201d This was thanks to one of my colleagues, who insisted on completing daily reps of stairs up and down the Travis Park garage.I felt instant restoration after just a few days of exercise. This simple exercise routine helped me deal with stress and gave me enough time to meditate on the things that pushed me towards triumph. Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you. The saying \u201cDon\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you\u201d has stuck with me since I was thirteen years old, and made the dumb decision to complain about my job in front of my dad. My dad was not fond of me complaining of the man who signed my checks, so he shared a lesson behind his belligerent words. This made me realize that my ego was blocking my ability to humble myself, and that I needed to be thankful to the people that were trying to help me. His wise words taught me to stay loyal to those who become part of my upbringing. This saying has stuck with me ever since, and I decided to mark it as a special lesson. A lesson I could only acquired through experience. I realize now the same goes with any organization or relationship that we hold, professional or non professional. We should be able to acknowledge where our loyalties stand, and if we are giving the proper amount of recognition to those who have helped us. The Codeup staff did everything in their power to plug me into a bigger network of opportunities. Lastly, I was exposed to a network of genuinely loving, and caring people. These amazing benefits make me appreciate the\u00a0Codeup program\u00a0so much more. I walked in with the desire to learn computer programming. I am leaving with the ability and skills that say \u201cI am a software developer!\u201d"}, {"title": "The Message Behind Our Billboards", "content": "You may have seen Codeup\u2019s billboards around town featuring recent career transitioners.

Like any scientific method, it involves gathering data, identifying a problem, forming a hypothesis, and running tests. More specifically, data scientists follow a process of gathering and cleaning data (wrangling), investigation (exploratory data analysis), building automation using machine learning (feature engineering, model development, and deployment), delivering results (visualizations, reporting, storytelling), and maintenance. Practitioners typically spend 70-80% of their time in the wrangling/exploration, 20% on machine learning models, and the rest in maintenance. Most importantly, this whole process should result in a valuable action or insight for the end-user, i.e. a business or customer! \u00a0 At its core, data is just information \u2013 names, dates, times, $$, etc. Data scientists work with large collections of this information to draw conclusions. For example, they might use financial data to predict the seasonality of revenue generation or use the events of applications (like logins, clicks, or downloads) to detect security threats or fraud. Data science typically deals with \u2018Big Data,\u2019 which is too large and complex to manage on a local computer (see 4 Vs of Big Data\u00a0for more). People interact with and create data like this every day: using smartphones, buying houses, rating movies, and more. You can thank data scientists (and the teams supporting them) for guiding you to your favorite Netflix series and helping optimize your workouts. \u00a0 There\u2019s always more than one way to eat an oreo, and data scientists use\u00a0dozens of different tools. At Codeup, data science tools include Excel, Python (programming language), SQL (databases), Hadoop (distributed data), Jupyter Notebooks (virtual notebooks for doing data science), and Tableau (visualizations). On top of that, they work with concepts from math, stats, and programming to write functions, create charts and graphs, and model patterns. \u00a0 Data science isn\u2019t magic, and it isn\u2019t rocket science either. At Codeup, data science is a skill set just like web development. The need for this discipline across all industries in San Antonio is rapidly growing and looking for new talent. If you\u2019re hungry to join the data revolution,\u00a0reach out to us today!"}, {"title": "Women in Tech Scholarship Recipient: Amy", "content": "One thing that I can proudly say after this whole Codeup process is that I survived (and thrived) as an independent woman, although not without\u00a0serious help from others! \u00a0This is my opportunity to thank those who have helped, including Codeup for generously offering me their\u00a0Women in Tech Scholarship.  Before Codeup, I was working full-time in another industry with a low salary. \u00a0I lived alone and was paying for all my rent and bills on my own, with no partner or parents for financial support. \u00a0In my field at the time, I struggled for years seeking advancement and growth opportunities from an industry that did not seem to value my skill set. Even given that stressful mindset, the idea of forfeiting my only source of income for several months to attend Codeup was\u00a0extremely\u00a0scary. \u00a0To justify this, I spent a lot of time researching, including attending\u00a0Codeup sponsored events, and reaching out to Codeup alumni and friends in the tech industry for their opinion. \u00a0Still, with all the encouragement in the world, my objections were: \u00a0 Let me just go ahead and assure you that everything worked out \u2013 very well, in fact! \u00a0I made the leap of faith and decided to join the Redwood cohort. Here is my first person to thank: a male friend of mine who has been a programmer for years, who strongly encouraged me that this was a great direction for me to take to secure fulfillment and my continued independence. \u00a0I struggled to find statistics on this, but I have heard many similar stories from women about the\u00a0men\u00a0in their lives (friends, family, boyfriends, husbands) who work in the tech industry and encouraged them to learn to code. On the first day of class, I counted: 6 women out of 23 total students. \u00a0Not bad! Despite the fact that these women were of different ages, marital statuses, careers, and stages of life, we all quickly bonded. \u00a0Within the first few weeks, we even planned our own Girls Night Out at a bar across the street from campus (that the guys from our cohort crashed, and I don\u2019t think anyone was upset about that)! \u00a0We also all participated in Codeup\u2019s weekly women\u2019s lunches, with featured female speakers who were alumnae or from the tech industry. Throughout the entire 18 strenuous weeks, these women and I supported and checked in with each other. Luckily, everyone in our cohort did the same, no matter the gender. \u00a0Thank you for this, Redwood women and men! \u00a0 To make a long story short, I was hired as a full stack developer a month before my graduation, with a decent pay bump from my previous career, and am now working in my second job in the field (yet another pay bump!) where I feel personally valued on a daily basis. \u00a0All of this, less than a year since\u00a0starting\u00a0Codeup! \u00a0As my final thank you, I am extremely grateful to Codeup for awarding me their Women in Tech scholarship, because it significantly reduced the loan amount I needed to attend, helped relieve a little bit of the anxiety of paying for Codeup, gave me more incentive to attend, and confirmed that I indeed was\u00a0exactly\u00a0what Codeup and employers were looking for in students and coders. If you\u2019re a woman who desires independence and self-fulfillment, Codeup is\u00a0worth it! \u00a0Make sure to apply to the scholarship during your admissions process and feel free to reach out to\u00a0me\u00a0or\u00a0other female alumnae\u00a0if you want to hear more about our experiences before, during, and after Codeup. \u00a0 \u2014 Amy is very proud to say she is currently the only female developer employee working on Whataburger\u2019s first ever online ordering platform. She has a Master\u2019s degree in Music Theory and keeps that knowledge fresh by analyzing music on the radio during her daily commute. Since learning to code, what she enjoys the most is mentoring new developers."}, {"title": "Anxious About the Job Fair", "content": "I hope you\u2019ve got your resumes ready, because\u00a0Codeup\u2019s\u00a0bi-annual\u00a0Tech Job Fair\u00a0is coming back this Fall! For most people, this is an exciting event, full of opportunity and new beginnings. While for some, the words \u201cJob Fair\u201d provoke anxiety and a deep-seated fear of proper handshaking.  (via GIPHY) To help a few of you entry-level folks out there, I sat down with my boss Fred Tawil \u2013 President of\u00a0Swipetrack Solutions\u00a0\u2013 and asked him if he had some advice for anyone attending the Job Fair in September. Interview With the Boss How did you get into tech? I taught myself how to program years and years ago. When I graduated as a political science major, I needed something to do. My dad owned bingo halls and he needed a player tracking system, so I figured okay, I\u2019ll make a player tracking system. I taught myself how to program, I built the kiosk and built the software to run the player tracking. As someone who didn\u2019t formally study something like CS, what has been the most difficult thing about managing a bunch of programmers?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know. Everybody has their own method of programming and development. It\u2019s that balancing act between getting something done quick and getting it done right. It\u2019s figuring out how much time we can spend making it reliable versus getting it deployed. That\u2019s true. There\u2019s always something new coming out in this industry. Yeah, it\u2019s always good to keep an eye out on what\u2019s coming up, that way you\u2019re not stuck when something gets depreciated or reaches its end-of-life. When you\u2019re hiring, do you typically read everyone\u2019s resumes? It depends. We typically glance at them. I understand that a lot of Codeup grads weren\u2019t in tech and are trying to move into it. That\u2019s actually good for us, especially as a small company. We like to see previous work history so we can hire someone with multiple skills. Back when you were conducting the interviews yourself, what are some things that would make a candidate stand out to you? Most of the time when we\u2019re hiring, we get a lot of competent coders that come to see us, and we see lots and lots of resumes. But an important thing for us now is, will this person fit in with the environment and will they like working here? When it comes down to the interview, you can be a competent coder, but what we want to know is if you\u2019ll mesh with the group of people here and if you\u2019re someone we can work with day to day. How important would you say it is for someone to have a personal website and to have recent commits on GitHub? I can tell you we looked at everyone\u2019s personal website if their resume looked good. GitHub accounts not so much, because a lot of the time when someone is coming from a coding bootcamp they\u2019re all the same. A lot of the websites also looked similar, but if there was a way that you set yours apart, we saw those and those were pretty interesting. For us it\u2019s not so much what you did while you were at Codeup, it\u2019s what else you did. Show me that you really enjoy programming and that you do it in your free time, as opposed to just looking for a higher paycheck. Do you have any apps in the App store, or a web application you made? Did you actually spend time on your website? I can tell you we do look at the source code and make sure if we\u2019re hiring somebody that they didn\u2019t just use a theme they bought on the internet and are pretending they built it. It\u2019s very easy to tell. Do you have any advice for anyone who is nervous about going to their first Tech Job Fair?\u00a0 It might be different, but I think it\u2019s more laid-back. I would say to just relax. The three or four times we did it, we enjoyed talking to people and finding those whose personalities stood out. So be relaxed, enjoy it, and just talk. From Personal Experience\u00a0\u00a0 I clearly remember attending my first\u00a0Tech Job Fair\u00a0back in 2017, only because I was extremely anxious every day leading up to the event. I would go to\u00a0Geekdom\u00a0after class and had late nights to make sure that my website and online profiles were ready to go. Once the day came and I got there, my first thought was to run back to the car. (Image: Tenor) Three Easy Steps Whether you\u2019re planning to attend the Tech Job Fair to find employment or to network, it\u2019s completely normal to be a little worried about it. So here\u2019s my advice: I can vouch for the importance of doing a little research before attending. Make sure to look at the list of companies who will be there and make a mental note of those that really interest you. You\u2019ll be better off and more prepared to ask all the right questions. If you\u2019re not quite sure how, \u201cHello, my name is\u2026\u201d goes a long way. This is the step that most people forget. If you find a place that you fall in love with, you need to follow up. Why wouldn\u2019t you? That would be like falling head over heels for someone on the first date and forgetting to call. There are plenty of fish in the sea and a simple email thanking them for their time could be the reason they remember your name. Pro Tip:\u00a0If you\u2019re currently in Codeup, you can even invite them to\u00a0Demo Day\u00a0and have another shot at impressing them with your new skills.  via GIPHY Bottom Line Most importantly,\u00a0STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF. Getting hired into a new company is a lot like entering a new relationship. Companies want to hire someone they can get along with everyday \u2013 someone who values their work and the company culture. Ultimately, you want to be hired by people who \u201cget\u201d you. It\u2019s usually easy to tell when someone is not being genuine, so avoid pretending to be someone you\u2019re not. Put yourself out there, smile and most of all, bring some hand-sanitizer because you\u2019re going to be shaking a lot of hands. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2014"}, {"title": "Codeup Student Check In: Month 1", "content": "Codeup welcomed our newest cohort, the Wrangell cohort, on July 23.

Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 1! Check out Month 2 and Month 3. We took the time to sit down with our Wrangell student to see how they\u2019ve been doing so far! Codeup: How did you hear about Codeup? Why did you want to apply?\nWrangell Student: My first encounter with Codeup was during a drive downtown. I\u2019m glancing at billboards while I\u2019m driving and I see Codeup on one of the billboards. I remember thinking I wasn\u2019t fully satisfied with my position in life, and my future goals aligned with Codeup\u2019s mission. So I took a risk and applied. C: What was the application process like?\nS: The\u00a0application process\u00a0is very easy to understand. You apply directly on the website, and a member of the team reaches out to you. There are a few steps in the process itself, including an interview, a campus visit and a skills assessment. C: Tell us about any financing options/grants/scholarships you received. Did you owe anything out of pocket?\nS: I\u2019m very happy to report my expenses are fully covered by a few grants and scholarships. The City of San Antonio\u00a0Workforce Solutions\u00a0grant, the Alamo College Techworks grant, and the\u00a0Women\u2019s Scholarship\u00a0all helped to cover the cost so that I paid nothing out of pocket. C: Describe a typical day for you from start to finish\nS: We start off with announcements and then what we call \u201cpush-ups,\u201d which are morning exercises to practice our chops. Sometimes we work on yesterday\u2019s assignment, or we jump straight into lecture. After lecture, we practice the material with an exercise. Then we have a lunch break. After lunch we come back and listen to afternoon announcements. We have lecture time again, followed by another exercise. C: Describe what you\u2019re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging?\nS: Right now we are learning how to interact with the Google Maps API. This is probably the most challenging thing we\u2019ve gone over so far. It\u2019s very different extracting and working with code that is not your own. It feels like learning coding conventions all over again. But it\u2019s still a lot of fun! C: How has the learning process/information gathering been?\nS: The learning process has been amazing. We use the Codeup curriculum website in combination with other resources, such as developer websites, and program documentation. C: What has been the most memorable part of this month?\nS: It is empowering seeing a project idea go from a blank slate to \u00a0a full functioning program. The most memorable part of this month was the first time I ran a program and saw all the colors and components jump out at me on the screen. C: How do you feel your skill level compares to when you started?\nS: My skill level has definitely increased compared to where I was initially. I think one of the most valuable things I\u2019ve been taught are the tools that developers use on a daily basis such as\u00a0Github, git, Node, the IntelliJ IDE and more. C: How have the instructors been helpful?\nS: The instructors are very receptive to feedback. They recognize that their students are extremely diverse with different skill levels, and respond in an understanding manner. They also encourage us to work hard for a problem answer, rather than just giving it to us outright. C:\u00a0 Can you share a fun experience you have had this month?\nS: It is so much fun talking to my classmates and realizing how kind and open they are. I initially wanted to be alone on my lunch break, but then I had so much fun eating lunch with my classmates! I feel that Codeup is even helping me overcome my shy nature, and feeling the change within myself is fun and enlightening."}, {"title": "Minorities in Tech Scholarship", "content": "We have exciting news!

The Codeup graduate has set a new standard at Digiboost, by not only meeting expectations but exceeding them with his passion for technological innovation. From humble beginnings as a military child, moving from place to place, to building a life in San Antonio, Texas, Cayden is a one of a kind talent, displaying a multitude of skills ranging from CSS, JavaScript, PHP and troubleshooting methods for solving developmental problems. At Digiboost, Cayden hopes to empower and enable small business to thrive in a corporate world with his distinct style and approach to coding.  \u201cI want to be a part of building up the Digiboost brand while also building up the small businesses that come to us for support,\u201d Simler said. \u201cI really want to contribute and give back in the best way I know how.\u201d After acquiring a taste for web development in high school, Cayden looked to Codeup as an alternative to obtaining a four-year degree. Codeup provided Cayden with a program focused on developing the skills required for his role as a web developer. Codeup\u2019s hands-on approach to coding proved to be helpful to Cayden, allowing him to immediately put to practice everything he was learning. In just 16 weeks, Cayden was certified in Full Stack Development, dubbed the status of Junior Software Developer, and matched up with one of Codeup\u2019s employer partners. The Codeup program is dedicated to providing its students with the skills necessary to effectively land an entry level coding position and launch their career in software development.  \u201cCodeup was designed exactly the way I needed it to be,\u201d Simler said. \u201cI gained the ability to problem solve, debug and learn new coding languages quickly. I \u00a0learned methods through whatever means necessary and created a fast entry into a career as a developer with the skills I needed to succeed.\u201d Since starting at Digiboost, the team has been beyond impressed by the level of commitment and efficiency Cayden has brought to the company. His developmental knowledge has brought him to become one of Digiboost\u2019s lead developers. \u201cCayden is a true asset to Digiboost,\u201d Brian Campbell, Digiboost Client Care Specialist, said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard much about Codeup or the types of skills they taught, but Cayden is quite versed in several different coding forms. He has proven to be a great resource, either with live customers or with employees in the office. In the future, I can see Cayden moving into a senior type role very fast. But I believe his skill set is something we need and want him to get more advanced in.\u201d Cayden\u2019s display of talent and proficiency have proved to be the type of personality sought out by Digiboost. His pursuit of excellence within his field has proven to be quite the journey, one that has earned the admiration of his team and colleagues. Surely, looking to the future, Cayden is bound to leave a lasting impact at Digiboost while growing and utilizing his incredible talents.  \u201cI\u2019m very excited for the future of tech in San Antonio and Codeup\u2019s role in the tech district.

But within the tech industry, it\u2019s even more tricky\u2014you want candidates with sharp skills and competitive experience, but also those who can make room to grow and adapt to new changes. The methods you use to recruit will directly influence who you attract, so you\u2019ll need to get innovative with your strategies if you want the best. Here are the top innovative measures being used in recruiting for the tech industry today. A candidate with formal coding education is a must. A candidate with years of workplace experience is even better. But neither will necessarily guarantee you\u2019re getting the best developer or programmer possible. That\u2019s where coding assessments come in. This skill-based method makes the recruitment easier by relying on hard data, which reduces unnecessary decision making and possible bias. It\u2019s the closest you\u2019ll get to knowing exactly how capable a candidate is, and exactly how they\u2019ll perform, logistically speaking, for your business. The interview process can be timely and even expensive, especially if you\u2019re hoping to attract global or out-of-town candidates. Whether you use it for the interview itself or just the pre-screening process, a virtual session makes more efficient use of the selection process, both in time, money, and convenience. Try Google Hangouts or Skype for a free method, or check out a software review site for the best video interview software available. These systems are known for being cumbersome and, ironically, even inefficient because they\u2019re so often hard to use or even used incorrectly. The good news is that these systems are simplifying their programs with the help of AI and rebranding themselves as \u201ccandidate relationship management software\u201d. Employers can now count on these programs to correctly track all potentials without error, as well as recommend new qualified candidates. The standard \u201cWhere do you see yourself in five years?\u201d question-and-answer interviews aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but they probably won\u2019t land you any innovative hires. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve begun to fall by the wayside, especially in the tech world. While the core questions are still important, tech companies are now rebranding their strategies to shake things up a bit and make room for assessing soft skills and personality\u2014the areas in which traditional interviews fall short. For example, the NFL susses out potential candidates by using Wonderlic, an online personality test that assesses emotional intelligence, determination, and overall demeanor.\u00a0 Companies are also ditching conformity by trying out unconventional meeting places like a coffee shop or cafe. It\u2019s all about getting to know a candidate better in a more dimensional way, and these new tools and methods are a way to get to know a truer sense of a person overall. And what about helping out with the time-consuming task of recruiting? Here are some of TrustRadius\u2019s Top Rated recruiting software for 2018, which help streamline the recruitment process of searching for, attracting, interviewing, and onboarding new personnel.

Don\u2019t let yourself become someone they barely remember. Find the recruiters on LinkedIn and connect with them.\nAdd a personal note as to why you want to connect with them. Consider recapping conversations you had at the job fair and reiterating what position(s) in which you were interested. Don\u2019t blindly connect \u2013 remind them of who you are! Use social media to your advantage! Companies are more connected than ever before, so what better way to show you\u2019re interested than by following them on social media? Some key ones include LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and possibly even Instagram. But, WHY social media? You\u2019ll be constantly in the loop of what the companies are up to and what they\u2019re in the business of doing. As a result, you stay relevant. In the advent of social media, apps are also on the rise. Set up alerts through your favorite job sites \u2013 almost all of which have apps. Here\u2019s a few that our Director of Employer Partnerships recommend: Do you have two resum\u00e9s? It\u2019s best to have two \u2013 one that is tailored for the role you want and one tailored to recruiters. Hand out the latter one to recruiters or at job fairs. It should also highlight the well roundedness of who you are! Step one: do you have a cover letter? Step two: is it one that can be tailored with minimal effort? While most companies nowadays don\u2019t require a mandatory cover letter, it\u2019s good to have one on file. This link has great tips on\u00a0prepping one. A good recruiter won\u2019t view working with you as a transaction. Working with a recruiter allows you to a) outsource a significant portion of the job search while also gaining a direct connection to a professional network b) give you access to a transparent job search process (such as company culture and interviewer style). In addition, it\u2019s in a recruiter\u2019s best interest to stay in touch with you once you accept an offer to make sure you\u2019re adjusting. You\u2019re not a transaction \u2013 you\u2019re an investment. When they see you continue to succeed, it allows them to stay at the top of your mind as you continue your professional path. Does your LinkedIn reflect that you\u2019re wanting to hear from recruiters? This is an often overlooked step, but is key when actively job searching. The next Tech Job Fair is scheduled for September 2018.

Hiring needs in the tech industry \u2013 specifically on software development teams \u2013 evolve almost as quickly as the technologies themselves. One year employers are trying to get their hands on Ruby developers, and 12 months later, a new JavaScript framework is all the buzz. This doesn\u2019t make things easy for job seekers or new employers looking to hire their first software developers. Drawing on conversations with our 200+ employer partners at Codeup, we\u2019ve compiled a shortlist of five trends we\u2019ve seen emerge recently. In a nutshell, it\u2019s all about solving problems for the end user. First, what is Agile? In a nutshell, it\u2019s a set of management practices that allows software developers to write code and build products more efficiently. Agile has gained serious ground in IT departments across a variety of industries, from finance to food service. While Agile doesn\u2019t explicitly require a team of full stack developers, it does ask developers to be fully engaged in all facets of building an application, from creating user stories to deployment. As a result, roles on an Agile team start to blur, and each individual winds up working on features across the tech stack.= There\u2019s no doubt that a team of specialized front-end and back-end developers can build great software. However, today\u2019s hiring managers seem to have a preference for full stack developers, or at least those who understand both sides of a given tech stack, because these well-rounded employees have a leg up on others in an Agile environment. Structure and efficiency are still important for software engineers to get right, but more and more, it\u2019s critical for developers to code across the stack with the end user at top of mind. In fact, Agile teams dedicate time to create user stories that inform the products they build, and each team member is involved in a recurring (or iterative) design process. Tim Brown, the CEO of international design firm IDEO, says, \u201cDesign thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer\u2019s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.\u201d Software is everywhere these days, and it\u2019s not just for techies. Solutions need to be slick, innovative, and easy-to-use. The latest version of iOS or Android needs to be impressive enough for tech enthusiasts to get excited about and straightforward enough for grandpa to check his voicemail. Most importantly, good developers realize those two things aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. Now more than ever, a strong understanding of JavaScript can really help software developers land a great job. Once a fairly basic, client-side scripting language, JavaScript has made powerful gains in functionality while staying lean and efficient. In recent years, Node.js, a server-side runtime, has transformed JavaScript into a full stack powerhouse. JavaScript continues to deliver on the front-end, too: React.js has revolutionized user interface development and has become the front-end JavaScript framework of choice for Fortune 500 companies and startups alike. Diversity in tech remains elusive and persists as a key talking point in the industry. Women, as well as black, Latinx, and LGBT workers, remain severely underrepresented. In light of this year\u2019s high-profile headlines on gender diversity issues at Uber and Google, many tech companies have doubled down on their commitments to boost workplace equality and employ people who authentically empathize with a diverse group of end users. We\u2019ve also noticed a growing trend toward diversity initiatives that aim to include nontraditional hires like military veterans, career changers, and candidates without four-year degrees. For example, the Microsoft LEAP initiative seeks candidates who have tech experience but may have been out of work for a while (e.g., stay-at-home moms or dads) or career changers with at least six months of software development experience. This is less of a hiring trend than it is a skill that employers continue to require of all new developers, especially non-traditional hires who may not have a computer science degree or years of experience. Software developers \u2013 especially those new to the field \u2013 are in a constant state of learning new technologies and solving problems they\u2019ve never encountered before. The ability to define a problem, recognize key inputs, and identify potential solutions is particularly important when the quality of a line of code depends on the developer\u2019s ability to think logically and efficiently. Interviewers often ask candidates to walk through a scenario, usually a past experience or a hypothetical case study, where the candidate needs to demonstrate their ability to assess a problem and formulate a solution. Sometimes these questions can be technical and quantitative, other times they\u2019re more behavioral, but either way, it\u2019s clear that companies want employees who think well on their feet and come to their managers with solutions instead of self-explanatory questions. Beyond these trends, employers continue to look for one thing above all else: technical skills! Before learning a new JavaScript framework and doing research on best practices for design thinking, you\u2019ve got to have the fundamentals of software development under your belt. That\u2019s where Codeup comes in. Our 18-week career accelerator gives you all the tools and training you need to capitalize on these trends and land a great job as a software developer.

A software developer can be front-end, back-end or full stack. Successful software developers come from diverse backgrounds and a variety of industries. Here at Codeup, our job is to advance existing careers and launch new ones. That means we\u2019ve seen it all. We\u2019ve learned that being a successful software developer comes from the right combination of personality traits and technical knowledge. We\u2019ve gathered a few questions to ask yourself if you are considering becoming a software developer. You will spend your time building, improving and maintaining different types of software across different pieces of technology. This means that working with computers, phones & tablets should be something you enjoy. This might sound obvious, but it\u2019s huge! We often meet students who are attracted to tech because of exciting new products, collaborative work environments, and flexible schedules. These are all awesome perks, but remember that the most important piece of your work will be the code itself. A software developer spends the majority of their time fixing problems and building frameworks. Technology is a constantly evolving industry. While one language is hot today, it might die tomorrow. Our co-founder, Jason Straughan, often reminisces about writing an entire book on a language that disappeared from use by the time the book was published. What does that mean for you? You should love the process of learning new skills and keeping up to date with cutting-edge technologies. A career in technology gives you the opportunity to reinvent yourself many times. You may love working with databases today and find that UI/UX is where your strengths are in a year. You will need to be able to adapt to changes in the industry and be willing to learn on the job or put in the hours on your own time. The more programming languages under your belt the more value you will be able to provide during every stage of your career. Grit is a character trait that can make or break long-term success. Psychologist Angela Duckworth explains it as, \u201cPassion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina\u2026sticking with your future, day in and day out.\u201d When it comes to software development, having grit means learning from your failures. We\u2019ve seen students struggle not because they can\u2019t figure out the content, but because they are afraid of failing. Move past that fear! You will inevitably make mistakes, but our successful students are those that learn from their failure along the way. At the end of the day, code is designed to solve a problem! Your ability to think logically, brainstorm creative solutions, proactively research answers, and fill gaps will make you an effective and efficient software developer. That\u2019s why we test for problem-solving ability in our admissions process. Do you like tinkering, Googling, fixing, solving puzzles, and finding your own answers? If you do, you may appreciate the challenges that come along with developing software and debugging code. These are the questions to ask yourself when making the decision to become a software developer. If you answered yes to these questions, coding could be for you. At Codeup we offer an 18-week career accelerator that will help you get a foot in the industry. Ready to start?

Here, they share their highs, their lows, their experience and their best tips for succeeding during and after the program. Stefanie: I\u2019m originally from California. I grew up in the Silicon Valley before the days of Google and had a pretty decent handle on free internet via AOL Trial discs, Napster torrenting, and multi-player gaming platforms (before they were cool). Given the mid to late 90\u2019s, I had quite a bit of backlash within the online communities for my gender and my age. I gave up on tech during my early college years when a female professor told me, \u201cthere no room for women in the booming tech industry.\u201d I quickly turned to music and language arts and found myself pursuing the long-term degree before leaving for Texas to enter a Japanese Studies program. I had a rude awakening and poor experience when most jobs I was offered were non-technical, non-creative, and extremely repetitive. It wasn\u2019t going to work. My grandfather had always been a firm believer that I was meant for tech, engineering and developing new ideas. After chatting with him about my failed attempts and unhappiness, I decided to give tech another try through coding and entered into the Codeup family. I worked full-time while attending a night class and found myself doubting my abilities from the beginning. During our first project, something clicked and with the help of the instructors, I had a new-found love for problem solving, developing and code. I haven\u2019t turned back since. Lorne:\u00a0I\u2019m also from California. \u00a0I hail from Oakland. \u00a0I\u2019m into just about everything. \u00a0I have worked as a high school basketball coach, personal chef, bartender, bouncer, opera singer, paralegal/legal assistant, and dance instructor. \u00a0I love movies and books\u2026.I read about 40+ a year. \u00a0I\u2019m into fantasy and sci-fi, but also enjoy reading Deepak Chopra and books about travelogues (which is somewhat funny because I\u2019m terrified of traveling). I\u2019m a hippie, jock, musician, and nerd. I love people and connection and for someone who grew up largely an only child, I\u2019m always out creating new family. \u00a0If something interests me, I pursue it. \u00a0I like to dive into things that I can share with others. \u00a0I\u2019m an avid NBA fan (Go Warriors!) and if you ever want to argue about basketball, I\u2019m game. \u00a0If you want to see me fully free and in my element, put me around music and dancing. Programming puts me back in my Lego days, where I get to be creative and build things. It\u2019s my new adventure.  Stefanie: I wasn\u2019t always interested in programming. I had always seen programming as a career that leads to a dark room with smelly individuals, Cheetos and Mountain Dew. I didn\u2019t want to be placed in a cubical and made to work 10 \u2013 16 hour days to complete a project or operating system. Web development when I first set out to learn tech was not a major degree option or talked about much. Browsers were faulty and new to the scene. It was a questionable career path at the time. My grandfather was an engineer with Stanford University and always brought home hardware for PCs. I thought that would be my path as well. I loved building and problem solving the communication errors between parts. Little did I know that programming was that too on a more abstract and dynamic level. Lorne: I absolutely thought programming was way out of my range and my experience. \u00a0Nothing about it felt like something I would be into. \u00a0I had simply grown out of my old position and location. \u00a0I was a paralegal in San Francisco and I was no longer challenged. \u00a0I wanted to go back to school or do something new but had no clue what. \u00a0It was too expensive to do there, my parents brought up Codeup (they live here), and here I am.  Stefanie:\u00a0Honestly, I was extremely doubtful of the program, especially after being trained into the thought process that traditional college was the only form of useful education and the only experience one should seek before career searching. It wasn\u2019t until I was trying to break into marketing firms, coding communities and design groups that I was told about the program. Three people approached me and recommended the program. I didn\u2019t listen. Then life started shouting it at me. I saw the billboard\u2026 then a marketing card in the mail\u2026 and then I heard a friend talking about their acceptance into the program. Finally I gave in and went to the Codeup location.I took a couple of tests and passed with flying colors. I decided to take the leap since they were offering a night program that started after work hours. Since they helped with job placement as well, I took them to be my chance at a better work life. Lorne: I was on the verge of going to teach English in Turkey when my parents suggested that I look at Codeup. \u00a0I took the test, not sure if I\u2019d get in, and then when I did, I bought a ticket the next day and the rest is history.  Stefanie: Overall, my experience was eye-opening. I did not expect to have young mothers, grandmothers, high school graduates or college graduates with Masters in the same class. The culture was liberating since we were all there for the same reason \u2013 to change our paths and achieve new goals. The instructors were very hands on and helped everyone thinking about problem-solving in new ways and how to attempt developing ideas out of nothing. The hardest step was always deciding where to start and finding the confidence to dive in, code first, and prepare to work through your own problems and use the resources available.  Lorne: Codeup opened my eyes to a new world. \u00a0They made programming and something that seemed so daunting, really fun. \u00a0I never thought I would enjoy it, but the collaborative nature of it and the creative juices that got to come out, made me fall in love with it. \u00a0The instructors, the classroom, everything about it made me feel like I could do it. \u00a0I think that was the largest thing. \u00a0Despite any difficulties or frustrating, I felt empowered\u2026like given time and community, I could solve anything. \u00a0That\u2019s an awesome feeling.  Stefanie: The program taught me independence and confidence. I am more free-thinking than I have ever been. I understand how to think about everyday issues from multiple viewpoints, and I know how to stand my ground and prove my points and way of thinking. I know that it\u2019s okay to be wrong and how to go about admitting it. Even if it seems counterproductive to building independence, I know it\u2019s okay to ask for help.The program also taught me about resourcefulness and communication on a whole new level. These two features alone were enough to land me just about any job. Soft skills are just as important as the hard skills.  Lorne: It taught me how to break down problems. \u00a0It taught me how to ask for help and that is perfectly right and ok. Codeup gave me my first job, and kind of my second, as I worked for one of the founders as my second. \u00a0They always believe in their students and help them match and grow.  Stefanie: Understand that this program is meant to accelerate your learning of development. You have to be hungry for this knowledge and supplement the curriculum outside of the classroom as well as practicing it. There has to be a drive for the goal ahead. Be willing to sacrifice some of your free time.This class is so much more rewarding if you learn to work as a class unit early on and help each other succeed. Employers will see it in your example work, the projects and want to hear about your ability to communicate and mesh well as a developer. Be open-minded and be willing to be wrong. I learned so much more from being wrong than from being right. Experience is priceless in the long run.\u00a0 Lorne: Stay patient and humble. \u00a0This world of programming is huge. \u00a0It can be overwhelming. \u00a0Just keep that learner mind and understand that time and keyboard time are your greatest assets. \u00a0\u00a0It may not feel like you\u2019re growing, but then you\u2019ll look up every now and then and realize just how much you know and how far you\u2019ve come. \u00a0It\u2019s a pretty awesome feeling.  Stefanie:\u00a0The staff and fellow classmates made the program great in my eyes. The interactions and experiences of having a new community of people who had similar goals made for a welcoming and productive environment. Lorne: I think the greatest part is the classroom. \u00a0The idea that when everyone shares knowledge, everyone succeeds. \u00a0The collaborative power of coding is insane and if there\u2019s anything I can attribute to the rapid rise of technology is that it brought a collective human mind to any problem. \u00a0People from all over the world now have the ability to work together to create brand new things. \u00a0You get your first taste of that in the classroom. \u00a0The sense that everyone wants you to succeed and you can lean on one another to fill in gaps where you may not be the strongest. \u00a0It\u2019s a really amazing feeling."}, {"title": "Alumni Spotlight: Mary-Kaitlin (MK) Warren", "content": "From being an Assistant Manager at Entreprise Rent-A-Car to becoming a stellar programmer, MK shares her path that led her to where she is now\u2014a student in the Microsoft LEAP program.  Random. My senior year of high school, I started watching Bones and first heard of Anthropology. So I majored in Anthropology. I also majored in German, because I wanted a back up plan in case I decided not to go to grad school for Anthropology, and everybody knows that companies are fighting over German majors. The spring semester of my senior year, I had no plan and my family told me that I needed to get a job, so I hit up Monster and applied to Enterprise\u2019s Management Training program. Randomly, I got the job. After 2 years I decided I didn\u2019t want to do that for the rest of my life. I got on Monster (I should send them a card) and randomly found Codeup. I think it was an ad? Pretty sure I didn\u2019t know what a bootcamp was at the time. After that, it gets less random and more Codeup driven. My first job after Codeup was with a company that had come to my Demo Day. The job after that was with a company that came to do onsite interviews at Codeup. I found out about my current opportunity through Codeup as well. So\u2026 three cheers (or jobs) for Codeup!  I had taken a computer science class in high school and done well. When I was looking to transition out of the customer service/sales realm, I knew that I wanted a set of hard skills, and luckily Codeup offered a place to grow those.  I thought about trying to do something online, like CodeAcademy, but I ended up going with Codeup because of the connections. Where as DIYing your coding education is possible, it\u2019s hard to get your resume through the door if you have no professional experience. Codeup helped make initial connections that have propelled me into the career that I want. Also, I am terrible at making myself watch videos online.  I am drawn to programming because there is an answer. If your code doesn\u2019t compile, there is a reason (and probably a silly one at that). It was a nice change of pace coming from a liberal arts background, where things are a little less black and white.  Definitely the snacks.  It\u2019s hard for a coding school to do this, because it is a business, but a little more clarity upfront about the types of positions to expect (especially in a market like San Antonio), would have been nice. Part of the reason why I decided to do Codeup was the claim that graduates made 15k more afterwards, and so I took out the loan for 15k with the idea that I could pay it back in less than a year. A month in, I realized that the average graduate salary was about 15k less than I was making, so that was a little disappointing and cause some numbers shuffling. Again, I know that\u2019s kind of a hard thing to change, but it\u2019s the only suggestion that I have. Everything else was pretty good. Well, speaking in hindsight, short term was to get paid to program and get some experience on my resume. Long term is to move into a tech arch role, change the world with some awesome software and/or hardware, and become Tony Stark. We\u2019re on the comeup. \u00a0I would say that San Antonio has a lot of companies that have very robust SWE communities that exist outside of the Downtown/Houston street epicenter. I think that because of the geography of San Antonio (read: sprawl), it is harder to see than a place like Austin or Seattle.  Codeup is there to support you. Practically speaking, their success is your success. Aside from that, everyone there is super supportive and just generally nice. If you aren\u2019t understanding a topic, the instructors are willing to help and walk you through it (even on their lunch break. WOW!!!).  This is a bit tricky. I would say that first and foremost, know you\u2019re own truth. Software isn\u2019t for everyone, so have that moment of honesty where you decide if you are doing this because you like the idea of programming every day, or because you like the idea of a 6 figure salary in 4 months and working from home everyday (spoiler alert: highly unlikely for your first, or dare I say, second programming job). If you are passionate about building software for the rest of your life, I honestly believe that Codeup is the best place to start that journey. The community is incredible; the instructors are amazeballs; the staff is incredibly supportive; and the founders are boss *** hustlers. It truly is the best place to start your development journey in San Antonio. (P.S. if you are from out of town, forget Codeup. Come to San Antonio for the breakfast tacos, and stay for Codeup.)  Dylan sent out an email with some information about the program, and it seemed like an awesome opportunity. If you don\u2019t major in CS, there aren\u2019t a lot of opportunities to \u201cintern\u201d for the Microsofts/Googles/Facebooks of the world. LEAP is awesome, because it gives you that same foot in the door that an internship gives, even if you didn\u2019t go the traditional Computer Science route. (Also: Seattle weather, multitude of hiking trails, coffee).  Keep learning. Become Tony Stark.  c:\\myPath. In other words, Codeup\u2019s Career Services and Development has gotten me 3/3 gigs. That goes to show that just because you get your first job, doesn\u2019t mean that you are out of the family."}, {"title": "Competitor Bootcamps Are Closing. Is the Model in Danger?", "content": "\u00a0 In recent news, DevBootcamp and The Iron Yard announced that they are closing their doors. This is big news. DevBootcamp was the first programming bootcamp model and The Iron Yard is a national player with 15 campuses across the U.S. In both cases, the companies cited an unsustainable business model. Does that mean the boot-camp model is dead? Bootcamps exist because traditional education models have failed to provide students job-ready skills for the 21st century. Students demand better employment options from their education. Employers demand skilled and job ready candidates. Big Education\u2019s failure to meet those needs through traditional methods created the fertile ground for the new business model of the programming bootcamp. Education giant Kaplan and Apollo Education Group (owner of University of Phoenix) bought their way into this new educational model when they purchased The Iron Yard and DevBootcamp. They purchased their competition with the intent to scale up the model. Unfortunately, Big Education is too habituated to coming up short for students. They bought the upstarts that challenged them, tried making changes to run those bootcamps in the \u201cBig Education\u201d way, and, sadly, they\u2019ve closed the doors when they realized that scaling education is more challenging when student outcomes truly matter. The bootcamp model is still new and there will be plenty consolidation, competition, and changes in the future. This model is based on actually being adaptive, innovative, and sustainable. And there\u2019s always room for innovation."}, {"title": "Codeup Doubles Down on Transparency in Student Outcomes", "content": "With pride and excitement, we\u2019d like to announce that Codeup is an official founding member of the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR). Codeup and all CIRR member institutions have agreed to a detailed set of student outcomes standards that eliminates unreliable graduation rates, ambiguous definitions of employment, and misleading exclusions from job placement rates. We\u2019re doubling down on our commitment to long-term student success, and we\u2019re confident that CIRR will add an extra layer of value and integrity that our alumni, current students, and prospective applicants already expect from their Codeup education. At all stages of the Codeup program \u2013 admissions, in-class immersion, and the job search \u2013 our staff and instructors aim to provide students with realistic advice, so they can make the most of their software development education. Historically, we\u2019ve done this in three ways: Even with ongoing efforts to improve these processes that monitor student success, however, we\u2019re the first to admit that we\u2019re human. As a small, evolving program, we recognize that we can always provide students with better feedback through detailed performance evaluations, structured student one-on-ones with instructors and staff, and transparency in student outcomes data. Our team has already addressed evaluations and one-on-ones, but forming a consensus on bootcamp outcomes data has been an industry-wide puzzle until now. We began resolving this issue by asking ourselves a follow-up question: With transparency and accuracy, how do we report on students who leave Codeup or do not obtain employment? Fortunately, other principled, results-driven coding bootcamps have asked themselves the same question, and over the past year, we\u2019ve come together under the CIRR umbrella. For the sake of our students, our alumni, and the future of our unique approach to coding education, we\u2019ve agreed to a detailed set of standards that establish new definitions, documentation, and validation requirements related to student graduation and job placement data. Critical feedback from students and alumni on bootcamp outcomes has informed so much of the CIRR process. Thanks to this input, the CIRR standards support the concerns of these very students by enforcing strict standards for student outcomes reporting and, in turn, providing Codeup with even more incentive to ensure student success. We appreciate our community for holding Codeup accountable to the high standard you deserve.

So what can students do instead? Forbes Magazine ranked San Antonio as the American city with the 15th highest rate of job growth in 2015 \u2013 no surprise given our city\u2019s recent swell in tech and entrepreneurship. The boom has created a mismatch between a surplus of available jobs for developers and a shortage of local technical talent. Codeup, a career accelerator that trains software developers and data scientists, has begun bridging that gap by training over 700 students and creating over $7 million in new tech salaries since 2013.  Codeup is different from traditional models of continued education. Four-year universities and two-year technical schools often no longer serve students\u2019 needs. The closure of ITT Tech, one of the nation\u2019s largest for-profit educational institutions, is a great example. Tuition at schools like ITT Tech, DeVry, and Kaplan is high ($45,000 \u2013 $90,000), they have been found to use predatory lending practices, and they rank highest among colleges that leave students in the most debt. Graduates of ITT Tech San Antonio who received federal financial aid earned an average salary of only $38,400 ten years after completion, just barely above the national average for the category. Their overwhelming time commitment, high tuition fees, and limited career support make it hard for students to complete degrees and advance their careers.  Given the decline of these diploma mills and a changing jobscape, other forms of education have exploded. The new reality is that the traditional college student archetype is now a minority, while demands for alternative, dynamic educational models are only increasing. Students need a better way to enter the workforce with relevant technical skills. \u00a0 As a six-month intensive career accelerator, Codeup offers something special: a place where students can find like-minded peers and launch a new career. Our classroom-based program turns non-techies into software developers. In addition to excellent technical instruction, students receive one-on-one career guidance and gain opportunities to connect with employers. If a graduate cannot find employment within 6 months, Codeup offers a tuition back guarantee. We partner with multiple reputable loan and grant partners to make financing easy, and also accepts GI benefits. Graduates have increased their salary by $17K in the first year on average.

Not sure whether the bootcamp\u00a0you\u2019ve just been admitted to is legit? Well, you\u2019re in luck! As Codeup\u2018s admissions director, I speak to dozens of current and prospective students everyday. I\u2019m here to help cut through the noise and\u00a0share feedback from those students, and help you on your path to picking the best coding bootcamp for you. Program fit and quality are key to launching a successful\u00a0career as a software developer, and there are six non-negotiables to keep in mind as you make your decision. We\u2019ve all dealt with disengaged teachers, but at a good program, you shouldn\u2019t have to. Be sure that there\u2019s a full staff of bona fide instructors that maximize individual attention and mutual accountability. Look for three things in your programming instruction: actual work experience in the industry (not just at the bootcamp!), a passion for teaching, and access to one-on-one tutoring. College computer science courses are heavy on theory, light on useful applications. That\u2019s great for some folks, but a good immersive coding program gives you the tools you need to get a job, and it\u2019s best to learn from people who\u2019ve been using them to build creations\u00a0of their own. When reviewing instructors\u2019 credentials, look past the fancy degrees and give brownie points for web development jobs and industry savvy. With that in mind, some of the most\u00a0brilliant software developers\u00a0simply aren\u2019t the greatest teachers. You want to be sure your instructors love interacting with students, explaining\u00a0complex concepts to beginners, and offering one-on-one help whenever needed. Also, when possible, be sure to do a campus visit and meet the instructional staff. The program staff should always be open to this. Alright, I\u2019ll say it. Be wary of coding schools with multiple campuses. Some bootcamps are\u00a0decent in one city and terrible in another. It\u2019s much easier for a program\u00a0to give you quality, individualized attention when the staff and instructors aren\u2019t answering to people in a different time zone. There\u2019s decades of evidence for this.\u00a0The country\u2019s best universities hunker down in one spot and focus on student success. Money-hungry diploma mills have locations in strip malls from coast-to-coast, some of which are known for high dropout rates and have been banned from recruiting military personnel. As with any decision in higher ed,\u00a0choosing a focused coding bootcamp makes all the difference. You\u2019ve probably heard people compare learning programming to learning\u00a0spoken languages. There are lots of similarities, but there\u2019s a big one\u00a0to keep in mind: immersion. Both types of languages are learned best through using the language all day, every day, with other people, for an extended period of time. A coding bootcamp worth your time\u00a0should provide a collaborative environment that immerses you in code. You\u2019ll be able to sharpen your new skills alongside a team of experts and vetted fellow students. Instructors push you to the next level, and when the going gets tough, you can always ask one of your bright classmates\u2014a whole group of bright classmates, in fact! What\u2019s the end game of any good coding program? Getting you a well-paid job at a company you like! First, check out the schools\u2019s job placement rate. If their admissions strategy and teaching are solid, it should be north of 90% over six months. This means they\u2019re accepting students who will succeed as developers, not just anyone who can pay the tuition. Next, take a look at the list of companies where alumni take jobs. Are they all funneled into one industry? What\u2019s the ratio of startups to corporations? A diverse set of post-grad placements suggests you\u2019ll learn the programming skills necessary to succeed in any work environment. Also, make sure the school\u00a0is willing to put its money where its mouth is. Good programs should guarantee you a job in a timely fashion or else give you a significant refund. Would you rather start something of your own? Even better! Keep reading below. The tech industry thrives in areas where entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and developers\u2014i.e., you!\u2014can easily get together and make the magic happen. Collaborative workspaces, like Geekdom in San Antonio, allow entrepreneurs to build new business and products together. Notable local tech companies like Rackspace and top-tier startup accelerators are also key indicators of a healthy ecosystem and provide important funding sources for new ventures. Cities with diverse, technology-heavy industries (e.g., healthcare, military, energy, aeronautics, automotive, and advanced manufacturing) also offer a strong commercial base to support tech entrepreneurs and job seekers. As you start to build things, it\u2019s also nice to be in a somewhat smaller ecosystem. Getting in on\u00a0the ground floor of a growing\u00a0tech scene gives you access\u00a0to willing and able mentors. Smaller tech cities also tend to have\u00a0lower costs of living. A new software engineer often finds it helpful to be a big fish in a friendly, easy-to-navigate pond, where the tech community\u2019s got her back in times of success and failure. Keep an eye out for schools with various funding options. Many offer loans that allow students to defer payments until after graduation. That\u2019s a huge\u00a0plus, but you should also ask about\u00a0non-profit tuition grants\u00a0and scholarships. And should you not qualify for these benefits, at least you can rest assured that third parties have vetted your school and its leadership is serious increasing access to education. Immersive coding programs can get you started on an exciting new career path. That said, big life transitions aren\u2019t easy. It\u2019s important to find the right program, and we encourage all applicants to\u00a0vet their options\u00a0for how well each school\u00a0teaches and accommodates their students. If you have any questions or comments about Codeup, or anything else, we\u2019d love to hear from you!

We designed our program to challenge students in a number of areas, but financing is not one of them. That\u2019s why we offer various financial options, enabling students to pay for Codeup with the funding plan that works best for them. Since we are always looking to accommodate the needs of our students, we recently added another form of payment to our list of funding options. James Canning, a current student who went through Codeup\u2019s application and on-boarding process from overseas, was able to pay the program fee entirely with bitcoin! Here is what he had to say about the experience: I recently started the full-time web development boot camp at Codeup in San Antonio, Texas. Codeup is one of the most comprehensive and best-reviewed developer training programs available. One of the main reasons I chose Codeup is because I was able to pay in bitcoin, the currency in which I receive my income. I always ask businesses I might transact with if they accept bitcoin; in the case of Codeup, I included this paragraph when I emailed them to enquire about the course: \u201cBy the way, if Codeup accepted bitcoin for payments it would be very beneficial for both parties. With a payment processor like Bitpay or Coinbase, Codeup gets instant USDs in its bank account for less than half the fees of credit cards or PayPal with 0 chargebacks and 0 fraud.\u201d Because Codeup does their invoicing through QuickBooks, they easily added the bitcoin payments option with QuickBooks\u2019 excellent PayByCoin feature, which uses Bitpay, the same processor Microsoft, Namecheap, Newegg and others use. Codeup emailed me the invoice as normal and I was able to pay the program fee in moments, from anywhere in the world. I will post a full review after the course, but so far the boot camp is excellent. Codeup achieves a friendly and supportive atmosphere and is thoroughly integrated into the local tech scene. Over 90% of graduates from the first four classes received job offers in the 6 months following the course. Personally I am not taking the course to get hired but rather to take my site, Bitedge, to the next level. If you want to learn web development and pay in bitcoin, then Codeup is by far the best option. If you use QuickBooks for your invoicing you should enable bitcoin payments!

Codeup makes an impact for gender parity in the San Antonio programming community.\u201d It\u2019s a perfect match of shared goals! Ryan goes on to say that his \u201cdecision to volunteer as a coach for Rails Girls is simple. Programming is the new literacy, and everyone should have exposure and experience in this field. I\u2019m thrilled that San Antonio will be hosting its first (of many) Rails Girls workshops.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Agreed, Ryan. \u00a0 \u00a0 Now, meet Tarek Hafez, a curriculum developer here at Codeup:\nTarek is passionate about learning and growing from the challenges he faces, and as a volunteer at Rails Girls he hopes to share his passion and knowledge with others. \u201cI can help to motivate and inspire those I seek to mentor, as well as educate,\u201d said Tarek, \u201cI could not ask for a better opportunity.\u201d \u00a0 Another awesome supporter of Rails Girls from our community is Jason Straughan, a Codeup cofounder, our CTO, and founder and head guy in charge of everything at a Grok Interactive, a web application development company. He\u2019s sending his developers to also mentor the event. \u201cLouis, Anton, and Joseph and I are going to be coaches for Rails Girls\u2026I\u2019m pumped,\u201d said Josh Freeman, senior software developer and former instructor for Codeup teen summer coding camps. Not only that, Joseph is a also Codeup-grad-turned-Grok-developer! According to Josh, the developers at Grok are never done learning and studying, an ideal that \u201cmeshes well with Rails Girls, where you\u2019re trying to train and introduce new people to programming. That\u2019s why we jumped at the opportunity.\u201d Although the Rails Girls workshop will only be in San Antonio for a weekend, the organization has already planted its compelling, and contagious, vision in our city.

Can I really learn a new set of skills in four months, become a valuable developer, and end up with a completely new job, new life, and new trajectory? And women especially bring a different set of sensitivity and caution. We meet their wise concerns with a great confidence-building foundation of real skills to maximize their value in the tech landscape. Can I really do this? Is there room for me in the 73% tech industry? Can I make a difference? Great questions.

The main takeaway after talking to both job seekers and job givers is that the San Antonio workforce isn\u2019t where tech employers want it to be. It\u2019s the responsibility of both the educators and the employers to become much more involved in solving that problem. Moving forward, there are two challenges for us as a community. First, educational programs (including Codeup) need to continue to evolve and guide talent beyond entry-level skills. Second, companies need to take talent development seriously to grow more senior talent out of these young people. We\u2019re working on the problem. It\u2019s time other parts of the community stepped up as well."}, {"title": "Why Choose Codeup?", "content": "Prospective students sometimes ask about how we compare to other coding education models.

Below is a Q&A from the end of his presentation. The first thing to ask is, \u201cwhat\u2019s the true value proposition?\u201d. So, \u201cwhat\u2019s the \u2018it\u2019 that\u2019s really going to be valuable?\u201d. The second questions is, \u201cwho is the customer?\u201d. You really need to understand your customer better than they understand him or herself. That means talking to customers, that means working with customers, that means actually going to people and saying, \u201clook I have this idea what do you think?\u201d. So define the true value proposition you\u2019re trying to provide, and then match that with real customers and real customer needs. Then the second step, once you make that connection and validate that value proposition with a customer match, is actually getting the \u201cit\u201d in front of somebody, or a version of the \u201cit\u201d in front of somebody to be able to sense whether or not it\u2019s really going to be viable. Investors love you, but they love paying customers best. So between you and the investor, there\u2019s the prototype, there\u2019s the app that helps convince them there really is a path forward and not just some guys who\u2019s nice to talk to but has nothing to offer. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on right now in high schools and middle schools, who are just beginning [entrepreneurship]. \u00a0Venture Labs, which is just down the street [from Codeup], is doing some really great work in trying to put that into the curriculum. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a fad or if it will be here permanently, but we are seeing a lot more of it. We\u2019re also seeing a lot more young college students getting involved in entrepreneurship. I love crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, I think it\u2019s a great way of determining whether your thing\u00a0is the upcoming thing\u00a0that people wanna buy. The problem with crowdsourcing is that there\u2019s just a lot of crap out there and there\u2019s a lot of people who are not only selling you something, but a whole bunch of stuff that you\u2019re not gonna get. So it\u2019s great if you\u2019re doing it for real and using it for the right reasons. From the inventor/startup side, it\u2019s a phenomenal way of being able to say, \u201cwe have 5,000 people who want to buy our special sauce and so now we\u2019ve taken that money we\u2019re gonna go bottle that sauce.\u201d But I urge you all to think about what the next thing is going to be. What\u2019s after crowdsourcing? We\u2019re already seeing a variety of that with equity crowdfunding, but is there something else that can be the next thing? When we think about the principles of crowdfunding, is there an opportunity to leapfrog and go just above that curve of innovation to be the first entrant, or occupy that first niche that does something differently? It\u2019s still the same, but it makes selling it easier. It\u2019s like, \u201cFacebook for cats,\u201d like, \u201cSea World without large mammals,\u201d like, \u201cUber, but for boats.\u201d It\u2019s easier to sell; there\u2019s a higher likelihood that you know who your customer are, because there are people using it already. The challenge is that some of the big companies are already thinking about those things and they have chosen not to pursue them for various reasons. The good news for startups is that maybe the reasons corporate companies chose not to pursue are the exact reasons why you should choose to pursue them as a startup: because they\u2019re too big, too bureaucratic to understand the real opportunity, or they chose to pass on it. Be careful with an idea that\u2019s similar to what other people are doing. Do your due diligence. Sometimes the patent literature is in the library and you can thumb through and see there was this old company that had that same idea 20 years ago, who then got bought out, and got bought, and got bought out, and no one ever did anything with it. Now if you\u00a0just tweak that idea\u2013by taking what they did and marrying it with the cloud, marrying it with crowdsourcing, marrying it with an app platform, social media\u2013you will then be able to see the right opportunity. If those guys are still around, it might be worth finding them and asking, \u201cwhatever happened to that?\u201d. You will need different pitches for different audiences at different times, so have them all ready. You should have your 10 second elevator pitch, your 2 sentence explanation of what you do, your 3 minute pitch, your Ted Talk; you should have a deck for an investors with appendices, a deck for sales to sell your thing. There are different kinds of ways of presenting for different kinds of audiences; have all of those presentations relatively polished so when that opportunity presents itself, you can pitch it right then. Be ready. Start with outlining the technically detailed way to say what you\u2019re trying to say to other engineers, computer scientists, people who are in the field who do and see the need and will be able to make the thing that \u00a0you need to make. Then, think of the 35,000-foot big-picture version of what you\u2019re trying to say, and sort of in between those is the rest of the world."}, {"title": "Exploring New Domains: ICANN\u2019s gTLD Program", "content": "\u00a0 The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a\u00a0non-profit organization responsible for maintaining the global Domain Name System (DNS), is in the middle of rolling out its new gTLD program,\u00a0which has\u00a0the\u00a0potential to\u00a0reshape how\u00a0users find information on the internet and\u00a0how\u00a0organizations build their identities online. Kevin Kopas, Channel Manager for Radix Registry, stopped by the Codeup classroom to help students better understand the gTLD program and\u00a0how\u00a0it\u00a0may transform the\u00a0domain\u00a0industry over the next few years. Domains are identifiers that create spaces of authority within the internet. A domain reflects an Internet Protocol address (IP address), which links\u00a0to the server where a website is hosted. \u00a0Domains are organized according to a hierarchical model consisting of top-level, second-level, and lower-level domains. Top-level domains (TLDs) constitute the highest level of domains in the DNS.\u00a0There are many types of TLDs\u2013including country codes\u00a0like\u00a0.us, .uk, and .jp\u2013and Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs), such as .com, .info, .edu, and .org. gTLDs are operated and managed by registries, like\u00a0Radix. Second and lower-level domains\u00a0directly follow TLDs and\u00a0are located to the left of the \u201c.\u201d in a domain. For a visual, in the domain \u201ccodeup20.wpengine.com,\u201d \u00a0\u201c.com\u201d \u00a0is the gTLD and \u201ccodeup\u201d is the second-level domain.\u00a0Typically, registries\u00a0delegate the responsibility of allotting domain names to registrars, such as\u00a0GoDaddy. Until recently, the list of gTLDs was limited to traditional strings, like the previously-mentioned .com and .net, as well as .gov, .mil, .org. and .edu. Over the years, the number of desirable and available second and third-level domains associated with these gTLDs has become increasingly scarce. To diversify the pool of available domains, ICANN is in the process of introducing\u00a01300+ new gTLDs.\u00a0These include everything from\u00a0.baby, .mls, .dot, \u00a0and .realty, to .sucks, and .buy.\u00a0Radix has acquired eight new gTLDs, including .space, and .website, and will soon be offering .tech. Registries can apply for a new gTLD through ICANN. In the case that multiple registries apply for the same gTLD, those companies partake in an\u00a0auction to determine the winner. ICANN runs its own auction to solve these contention sets; however, companies have found ways to resolve these disputes before reaching ICANN\u00a0through private auctions like Applicant Auction, which have their own rules and regulations. Sometimes companies even negotiate deals on their own instead of conducting\u00a0a private auction. The winning price for each gTLD varies. Registries often play a high-stakes guessing game where big\u00a0prices have the potential for big returns. For example, on the low end of the\u00a0March 2015\u00a0ICANN auction \u00a0, .srl was purchased for $400,000; on the high end, Google purchased .app for $25 million. In Kopas\u2019 opinion, slowly but surely, the .coms and .nets of the world will become overpowered by more specific gTLDs. While the impending end of the .com era may be sad for some, this shift also opens up new opportunity for creativity and specificity in a company\u2019s branding and marketing. With a more diverse list of available gTLDS, companies can better align their web presences with their\u00a0products or services: a beauty salon could use\u00a0.salon or an independent realtor could use .realtor. On the flip side, users will be able to tailor their searches based on a company\u2019s gTLD. This change also has the potential to offer credibility to businesses in certain industries. For example, in order to obtain a .law domain, the applicant must be a licensed practitioner. But will these new gTLDs ever really become the norm? Will\u00a0Google\u2019s $25 million investment in .app produce a sizable ROI? Only time will tell. In order for this shift to happen, consumers\u00a0must understand the industry and recognize the new variety of available gTLDs. Thanks to Kopas,\u00a0Codeup students are now \u201cin the know\u201d\u00a0about the changing domain of domains! For more info on the upcoming gTLD changes, check out ICANN\u2019s FAQ page.

Git, while primarily a tool for version control, can be used to facilitate this kind of interaction. Freeman recommends two simple steps to maximize communication in Git. 1. Use the Git commit as an opportunity to increase communication by explaining the changes you make to your code, as opposed to explaining it in a comment. Set up a Git commit template, or a standardized layout for commit messages. Freeman\u2019s template is listed below. Don\u2019t forget, your commit message summary must be 50 characters or less; all other lines should be under 72 characters. (Configuring your Git commit template) Example Git Commit Template: 2. Organize your commits logically. Sections of code that don\u2019t relate to each other shouldn\u2019t be committed together. Instead, break your code into logical sections and commit each section separately. You can accomplish this by adding to the index in patches, which allows you to stage parts of files and provides finer control over what you commit. Maintaining an organization to your commits will make it much easier to communicate via the commit template. (Adding to the index in patches) Following these two simple Git guidelines can prevent frustration that arises when deciphering code. Communication is key not only for your current team members, but also for your future self or future developers who may inherit your code sometime down the line."}, {"title": "The Delorean Gets a Ride", "content": "Our beloved Delorean took a ride in the tow truck today.

Read on for\u00a0six SEO takeaways from his presentation. The title tag, or the text written on the tab of your website, is a huge factor in your SEO ranking and should be as simple and straightforward as possible. The title tag is not the place for creative metaphors or puns: if your website is about finding cheap flights, the word \u201ccheap flights\u201d should most definitely be in your title tag. Likewise, the keywords you choose to emphasize on your website\u2013especially the keywords within the first block of content on the homepage\u2013should convey your purpose as concisely and simply as possible. Borrowing from the wisdom of Parks and Rec\u2019s Ron Swanson, this quote means you should avoid spreading the same keywords across multiple pages on your site. Decide early on which keywords you want on each page and stick to it. If you need to reuse a keyword on a separate page, you can always put it in an image (which Google can\u2019t read) or link it back to the original page where the keyword is emphasized. Never use the words, \u201cclick here\u201d on your website to direct users to links or documents. \u201cClick here\u201d has been used so frequently to link to Adobe PDFs that, when you Google it, Adobe Reader is the first or second item listed. Using \u201cclick here\u201d can actually hurt your SEO. Instead, use a link title that describes the\u00a0content\u00a0to which it\u2019s linking. Example:\n\u201cFor more information about Codeup\u2019s Teen SummerCamp, click here.\u201d = WRONG!\n\u201cLearn more about Codeup\u2019s Teen SummerCamp.\u201d = RIGHT! Shareable content, like a free brochure or infographic, can increase the amount of people linking to your site. When it comes to SEO, quality links are golden. You want as many quality links as you can get! Google is changing their algorithm (again) to factor in a site\u2019s mobile-friendliness. This change is set to be released during the week of April 21st, 2015. If you want to maximize your SEO (and minimize mobile users\u2019 frustration when browsing your site), you must ensure that your website uses responsive design. Not sure if your site is responsive? Use Google\u2019s free mobile friendliness test\u00a0to find out."}, {"title": "Programming \u201cLike a Girl\u201d", "content": "The Six Female ENIAC Programmers\nBetween 1943 and 1945, six women programmed the ENIAC\u2013one of the earliest electronic general-purpose computers in the world\u2013as part of a U.S. Army project. Without the luxury of programming textbooks or tools, Kathleen McNulty, Betty Snyder Holberton, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Jean Jennings Bartik, Ruth Lichterman, and Frances Bila Spence programmed an 80 foot-long by 8 foot-tall machine with over 3,000 switches to run a ballistics trajectory in just seconds. Although these women receive credit for this feat nowadays, their names weren\u2019t even mentioned when the machine was revealed in 1946. Grace Murray Hopper\nEver wonder where the term \u201cdebugging\u201d comes from? Rumor has it this colloquialism traces back to Hopper, who literally had to extract a moth from inside a computer while troubleshooting. Dubbed \u201cThe Queen of Software,\u201d Hopper graduated from Vassar College in 1928 with a B.A. in mathematics and physics and later joined the Navy Reserve during the war. She was the first woman to obtain a PhD in Mathematics from Yale and the first female to reach admiral rank in the Navy, where she worked on the first programmable computer in the U.S., the Mark I. Hopper also developed COBOL (common business-oriented language), one of the first modern programming languages. That\u2019s a lot of firsts! Ada Lovelace\nThe daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Lovelace\u2019s mother steered her away from her father\u2019s literary tendencies and toward mathematics. Lovelace met English mathematician and engineer, Charles Babbage, at a party in 1833, where he told her about early plans for his Babbage Engine. Later on in 1843, Lovelace translated an article on the engine into French, adding her own notes about using a series of operations with the computer to solve a mathematical problem. Although the engine was never successfully built, Lovelace\u2019s writing is considered the first published description of such a process; because of\u00a0this, she is sometimes called the \u201cfirst programmer.\u201d Radia Perlman\nThe world knows Perlman as \u201cThe Mother of the Internet,\u201d but\u00a0she resents the title, arguing that no single person can be responsible for this impressive accomplishment. Perlman developed the Spanning Tree Protocol, which allows loop-free topology for bridged Ethernet areas. Perlman has a B.S. and M.S. in mathematics and a PhD in Computer Science, all from MIT. She holds over 100 patents and has won multiple awards, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from Usenix. Karen Sp\u00e4rck Jones\nJones, a British computer scientist, is credited with inventing IDF in 1972. IDF, or \u201cinverse document frequency,\u201d is the statistical method behind weighting terms in search engines, which helps rank their importance when a user enters a query. Variations of IDF are used in modern search engines to rank a web page\u2019s relevance to a user\u2019s search.

Unquestionably, education makes us broader thinkers and more sparkling conversationalists. Education makes us more actualized humans. But as a finance guy, a small evil part of me always applies the $64,000 Wall Street question to every activity \u2013 from brushing my teeth to tossing a ball with a (in my case, non-existent) dog. [1] It\u2019s the bottom-line question: \u201cHow is this making me money, like, right now?\u201d [2] One of the problems of education, generally, is that we have a hard time proving or quantifying its value. What is the value of holding your shoulders back and head high when you walk into a job interview, knowing you\u2019re the best they\u2019re going to interview that week? Or the value of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of \u201cBoom! I got this!\u201d Philosophically, how can you put a value on just knowing more stuff? The weird thing about my friend Michael Girdley \u2013 who started the computer coding school\u00a0Codeup \u2013 is that he\u2019s ambitious enough to say that the education community tradition of waving a hand at hard-to-measure fuzzy feelings is not good enough. Just because the education community finds it difficult to measure value doesn\u2019t mean that business people shouldn\u2019t try. In less than two years he\u2019s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education.\u00a0By that, I mean the bottom-line question: How is this making me money, like, right now?\u00a0Girdley shared with me the pre-Codeup and post-Codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries. Using a couple of his statistics, I want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student\u2019s investment in Codeup. \u201cThe average Codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.\u201d What does that really mean? What can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working years at this higher salary? It would be great to say that a Codeup education is worth 30 times $13,035, or $391,050. However, money in the future is not as valuable to me as money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate.\u00a0I mean, you could figure it, but finance guys will give you the\u00a0time value of money\u00a0speech that you don\u2019t want to hear again. With a salary increase of just $13,035, we can\u00a0calculate\u00a0what that amount is worth today by using a\u00a0discounted cashflow formula. So let\u2019s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 years of earnings, elevated by $13,035. I have to assume a \u201cdiscount rate,\u201d which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. I\u2019m going to assume a 5% discount rate. [3] Using my 5% discount rate, I estimate the value today of my elevated salary to be $200,379.90. That\u2019s the sum of 30 years\u2019 worth of $13,035, but \u201cdiscounted,\u201d or translated back, into today\u2019s dollars. That discounting allows us to more accurately compare the $16,000 tuition for Codeup with the total financial value, today, of that education.\u00a0By that measure, you pay Codeup $16K today for something worth on average, $200K,\u00a0today. [4] Another way of putting it is\u00a0that you are buying something today worth 12.5 times that amount. With these numbers, Codeup sounds like pretty good deal.\u00a0 \u201cThe average web developer, nationally, earns $91,750. That\u2019s $61,525 more than the average pre-Codeup salary of surveyed Codeup students.\u201d So that\u2019s interesting. We can imagine a number of reasons for this difference which don\u2019t have to do with the value of Codeup. Maybe the average web developer is older and more experienced on the job than the average pre-Codeup student. Maybe national salaries are higher than San Antonio salaries, on average. I mean, I\u2019m sure they are. But still. If one of your goals is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfly stroke. How much would 15 peak years of earning $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now?\u00a0Again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as high as 15 times $61,525, or $922,875, because of the whole discounted cashflow of\u00a0money in the future not being worth as much money today.\u00a0Also, to be fair, you probably won\u2019t earn the average national salary until you had a few years to ramp up your career. But what about discounting 15 years of an additional $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, starting 5 years from now, using the exact same formula that we used before? [5] Discounting those 15 years of earning the average industry salary gives me a value, today, of $500,366.44.\u00a0Which, to state the obvious, is 31X the price of tuition. With those kinds of numbers I start to feel like that sales guy from Entourage: \u201cWhat if I was to tell you that you\u2019d pay $16,000 tuition to Codeup for something worth $500K today? Is that something you might be interested in?\u201d Look, seriously, there are a lot of assumptions embedded in my statement that \u201cyou could pay $16K in tuition today for future salary jumps worth $500K, today.\u201d Most important of these is the assumption that, by training as a programmer, you can earn the national average salary for programming jobs. And we all know there\u2019s no guarantee that happens. But \u2013 and this is a big but [6] \u2013 it\u2019s not a crazy assumption.\u00a0Because, really, it\u2019s an assumption that the average happens. It\u2019s an assumption that you could be paid what other people in your industry are generally paid. It\u2019s an assumption that markets are somewhat efficient. \u00a0It\u2019s an assumption that, if you have valuable skills, you can find employers and work situations just like other people. All of which makes me pretty confident that the financial return on a skills upgrade like Codeup can be somewhere between 12 and 31 times the upfront tuition cost. As I said before, education leads to more sparkling conversations as well as to a more fully actualized life. Of that, I have no doubt. But I appreciate my friend Girdley\u2019s business-like approach to showing that the value of his program can be somewhere between a 12 and 31 times multiple of your investment.\u00a0Just thinking like a finance guy, is that something you might be interested in? \u2014\u2014\u2013\n[1] Notice I haven\u2019t gotten a dog because \u2013 I ask you \u2013 where\u2019s the profit in that?\n[2] I\u2019m still working on monetizing my teeth-brushing.\n[3] How did I come up with 5%? Sorta kinda I used art in addition to science. You could call inflation 2%, so that\u2019s a baseline for discounting the value of money in the future. Then there\u2019s the future risk of actually earning the elevated salary, which after all is a big assumption, and also an average, and as we always say in finance \u2018results may vary, past performance is no predictor of future results, etc,\u2019 so there\u2019s a few % points added to the inflation rate to account for that kind of risk. If you don\u2019t like my 5% assumption, make your own, I can\u2019t promise you I\u2019m \u201cright\u201d about a 5% discount rate. You might be just as right with a different assumption. Also, remember the faux philosopher and native San Antonian Jack Handey is a good guide to these disagreements: \u201cInstead of having \u2018answers\u2019 on a math test, they should just call them \u2018impressions,\u2019 and if you got a different \u2018impression,\u2019 so what, can\u2019t we all be brothers?\u201d\n[4] In addition to the $16K tuition of course you have to do a lot of work to not only learn to code, but also, you know, earn a salary in the future. So there\u2019s still that whole \u2018work\u2019 problem. But if you have to work, it\u2019s nice for the finance part to at least make sense, no?\n[5] Why did I choose 15 years and not 30 this time? Mostly because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to assume a Codeup graduate\u2019s salary jumps immediately to the average national salary. You work up to that. For that same reason, I calculated the value with a 5 year delay, to account for a slow ramp-up. Again, Jack Handey comes to mind: \u201cIf you ever teach a yodeling class, probably the hardest thing is to keep the students from just trying to yodel right off. You see, we build to that.\u201d\n[6] Hhhnn-huh. Heh. (Shut up, Beevis.)\n"}, {"title": "Demo Day Summary", "content": "\u00a0 Demo Day at our new space in Geekdom\u2019s Event Centre was a success!

While our first class was 95% San Antonio residents, we\u2019re now seeing over 50% of applicants from outside our fair city. This recent article from Silicon Hills News is pretty representative of this trend. Laura Lorek, the founder and publisher, profiled a number of the folks who\u2019ve come from places like Indiana, Missouri or Austin to do our program: http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2015/01/16/new-web-developers-debut-at-codeups-demo-day/ We\u2019re excited that the word is getting out about our work."}, {"title": "Can a Simple Algebra Test Predict Programming Aptitude?", "content": "Every year since the establishment of Computer Science in the 1960s, 30-60% of CS college majors have failed their Introduction to Computer Science course because they simply could not learn to program. Despite hours of studying and tutoring, most of these underperforming students struggle with, and many ultimately give up on, programming as a career. So here is the ultimate question- Can a simple algebra test predict programming aptitude? Education researchers have been looking for the answer to that question for well over five decades. In that time, they\u2019ve looked at dozens of possible predictors of programming aptitude, including: Most of these studies have found little to no predictive power in the variables they looked at. Or worse, when they do find something that\u2019s predictive of programming aptitude, the techniques appeared to be so complicated that other researchers are unable to replicate their results at another university. Our impression is that research in this field has slowed. At this point, there seems to be no silver bullet for predicting one\u2019s aptitude for early programming success. We\u2019ve been running a hands-on coding Bootcamp that jump-starts students\u2019 careers as computer programmers specifically for web application development. We accept less than 1/3rd of applicants. As part of the screening, we have prospective students take a basic algebra test. We also gauge student progress throughout the course and take note of individual progress using an internal normalized stack ranking. A student is given a 4.0 if they\u2019re at the top of their class, and a 1.0 if they\u2019re struggling to apply concepts learned in class. These stack rankings serve two purposes: first, they reveal who should be receiving 1-on-1 help and tutoring during the Bootcamp and, second, they stand as a useful measure of each student\u2019s early programming prowess. Now that we\u2019ve had over 60 students through our Codeup Bootcamp program, we decided to plot the two variables \u2014 performance on the algebra test and programming aptitude \u2014 against each other. Below, each dot represents a graduate. \u00a0 Shown above, our students\u2019 performance on the algebra test predicts their future performance on programming tasks. As with all studies involving human subjects, there\u2019s a fair amount of variance and outliers (e.g. the highly-rated student who scored only a 52% on the algebra test). But we can still confidently say that a student who scores a 75% or higher on the test will most likely be an above-average programmer, whereas a student who scores 60% or below will most likely be a below-average programmer. It\u2019s important to note that students graduating from our Bootcamp program are entry-level web developers; they can write a complete MVC web application using PHP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript from scratch, but they won\u2019t immediately be leading the software design team for the next Twitter or Facebook. It\u2019s fairly common for incoming Computer Science majors to ask the question, \u201cWhy do I have to learn all this math if I just want to learn to program?\u201d The correlation above suggests a possible answer: The ability to understand basic mathematics is likely correlated with the ability to \u201cthink algorithmically,\u201d which is well-known to be a foundational skill for expert programmers. Computer Science was founded in mathematics, after all. On a more practical level, we\u2019ve possibly found a simple method for sorting out the ninja programmers from the less capable programmers. So, if you\u2019re a college student considering a major in Computer Science, take a look back at your algebra scores from high school to get a sense of your algebraic aptitude. And if you\u2019re a recruiter for a growing tech company, try adding a basic algebra test to the interview process when hiring new programmers. In both cases, a 1-hour math test could save you thousands of dollars. At the beginning of the Codeup Bootcamp program, students are given between 35 and 55 minutes (depending on the test version) to complete a basic algebra test. The test contains 25-40 questions, such as: Adriana\u2019s age is 1/3rd of her dad\u2019s age. If her dad is 36 years old, how old is Adriana? and There are 3 consecutive integers with a sum of 69. What are they? No partial credit is given. To determine a student\u2019s overall stack ranking, we have our instructors periodically rank each student according to how well they have been performing in the current programming module. Students are assigned a 4.0 if they\u2019re at the top of their class, and a 1.0 if they\u2019re struggling to understand and apply coding concepts. The majority of the students receive rankings of 2.0 and 3.0 such that the stack rankings for the entire class form a normal distribution. A student\u2019s overall stack ranking is simply the average of their stack rankings over the entire Bootcamp. The chart above shows the linear regression over the performance data of all 62 students who have graduated from Codeup Bootcamp. These 62 students come from 3 separate cohorts who took 3 distinct algebra tests. Scroll to the graphs at the bottom of this post to see that, when applied to the data from individual cohorts, all linear regressions show the same positive correlation between test score and programming aptitude with p < 0.01. This finding has therefore been replicated twice with three distinct cohorts of students. In summary, these math tests \u2013 along with stack rankings \u2013 have been a handy diagnostic tool for us, and we\u2019d like to share our findings with the world in an effort to both shed light on our own experience and hear plenty of feedback from others. In this new and growing industry, there is so much to learn, and we hope that this study provides food for thought and space for conversation.

Programmers with real-life coding skills are in high demand but prove difficult to find. Where do employers start looking? What skills should they be looking for? San Antonio has a treasure chest of programmers hiding in universities, bootcamp programs, and tech communities just waiting to be hired. College grads are eager to jump into the workforce after a rigorous four years of tests and lectures. Graduating\u00a0Millennials have a sense of mission; they\u2019re ready to make a difference in the world and the companies they work for. San Antonio colleges like the University of Texas at San Antonio and Trinity University have top tier computer science programs that produce swells of potential hires every year. Employers can contact UTSA\u2019s computer science department to be listed on their\u00a0page of job opportunities or make a profile on\u00a0Campus2Careers. Students pour a strong foundation for their career by getting their degree but don\u2019t usually gain applicable skills from college curriculum alone. Curriculum can become quickly outdated with the ever-changing methods of the technology industry. If they don\u2019t develop their programming skills independently of their schoolwork, they fall into the large majority of job applicants that don\u2019t know how to solve\u00a0basic coding problems. Graduation is only once or twice a year, leaving a short window of employment opportunity. The students who already know how to code have jobs lined up long before they get that diploma. When graduates realize they can\u2019t find a job without real-life coding skills, they often look for a way to fill the gaps in their university education. In need of a quick, effective way to learn, they turn to our program, Codeup. And it\u2019s not just college grads; individuals from all walks of life come to Codeup to change the trajectory of their careers. They want to be programmers, designers, builders of products and ideas. In three months Codeup students get over 700 hours of instruction from experienced programmers equipped with the most relevant knowledge. The intense program produces individuals who have worked on realistic projects and are ready to jump into the workforce. They have a portfolio of work to show, they have experience, and they have passion. With a class graduating every three months there\u2019s plenty of chances for employers to grab someone with real skills. We believe that must be pretty good if 93% of Bootcamp students from our first cohort have found jobs within four months after graduating. Universities and accelerated learning programs aren\u2019t the only places companies looking for a programmer can search. Technology meetup groups provide a casual, encouraging environment for savvy programmers who want to hangout with likeminded individuals. There are plenty groups in San Antonio:\u00a0San Antonio New Tech,\u00a0SA Open Stackers,\u00a0Alamo City Python Group,\u00a0San Antonio Dev Ops,\u00a0San Antonio Web Development Group, and\u00a0JDEV Meetup, just to name a few. Groups like these give opportunities to pre-screen candidates who potentially have more experience than those exiting learning programs. Employers need to be careful with their approach, though. It\u2019s inappropriate to make an announcement about a job position at events like these; the group wants members of the community to engaged and involved, not just headhunters. This process is more time consuming but can be effective with consistency and patience. A lot of the meetups are held at\u00a0Geekdom and are populated by Geekdom members. Posting on the\u00a0Geekdom job board is a quick way to get to the people who are looking for immediate employment and reduces the amount of hours spent attending events. If all else fails, employers can post job opportunities on social networks, ask friends, or take a chance with Craigslist. There is no such thing as the perfect job candidate. The structure of code, frameworks and libraries used, testing conventions, requirements, and deployment management are all based on what the company needs\u2014 everyone is different. As long as the candidate can prove their knowledge in tracking real coding scenarios, the rest is simply a culture fit."}, {"title": "Top 3 Reasons to Attend Codeup Demo Day", "content": "\u00a0 Why attend the next Codeup Demo Day?

According to a study on the cognitive effects of learning and computer programming, when kids learn how to program, they\u2019re not just learning a programming language, they\u2019re \u201cgaining powerfully general higher cognitive skills such as planning abilities, problem-solving heuristics, and reflectiveness on the revisionary character of the problem solving process itself.\u201d Through learning code, kids are learning to learn. Coding will be an important skill for the next generation, who will be more connected to the web than any of their predecessors. Here are a few great programs for kids and teens in San Antonio: San Antonio Youth Code Jam is an annual, semi-unstructured event backed by the 80/20 Foundation, Rackspace Hosting, SAStemic and other sponsors that help keep this event free. Kids bring their own laptops and other tech gear to have a day of code exploration. A collaborative environment allows kids to meet other kids who like the same things they do while learning from each other. Webmaking and digital literacy are developed through fun drag-and-drop games or more involved personal projects. Until the next event, check out their list of digital resources. Branching off of the regular Codeup programs,\u00a0Codeup Teens gives high school students the chance to learn something often left out of traditional school curriculum. Every 4th Saturday of the month at Geekdom they can get an afternoon of instruction with the Codeup staff. Students usually work on web technologies like JavaScript or Scratch, but the team will always make accommodations based on the student\u2019s skill set.\u00a0TurnerLogic CodeKids runs a similar program for middle school students. SAStemic is vital to San Antonio\u2019s technology environment. They advocate to fill the wide spread need for STEM education in schools and communities. Initiatives like\u00a0Geekbus provide a traveling makerspace filled with 3D printers, robotics, and other electrons for exploring. Schools get access to STEM experiences without having to buy equipment or leave the classroom. Other programs prepare students for national competitions like the\u00a0National Youth Cyber Defense Competition and the Alamo First robotics competition. Hopefully with continued efforts from SAStemic, San Antonio will see strong STEM programs in every school. The tech community continues to give opportunities specifically for women; Girls Inc. inspires little ladies to pick up a computer and start writing code. They just kicked off a program in San Antonio partnering with\u00a0Made with Code to give San Antonio girls a safe place in an industry dominated by boys. In a collaborative space, girls make friends, code 3D printed bracelets, and program avatars to dance across their screens. Teaching kids to code enables youth to learn the process of learning itself, which puts them at a huge advantage amongst their peers in continuing education. With programs for every gender, tech savvy level, and age group alike, there are so many opportunities for kids in San Antonio to start coding."}, {"title": "Where to Learn to Code in San Antonio", "content": "Without any background knowledge it\u2019s easy to end up in the wrong level of instruction, learning the wrong code, at the wrong time. Whether it\u2019s a full-fledged degree or a 3-month bootcamp, there\u2019s an array of opportunities for aspiring programmers in San Antonio. The most traditional route to a programming education is enrolling in a university or community college. Almost all of the major universities in San Antonio, including The University of Texas at San Antonio, Trinity University, and Texas A&M San Antonio offer a degree in computer science. The Alamo Colleges also has associates degrees in\u00a0computer science\u00a0and certificates in related subjects like C++ , Linux, SQL and Java. Attending a university is expensive; tuition at these schools usually runs from about $10,000 to $60,000 a year, which can quickly add up to an unmanageable amount after four years. Two years of core curriculum filled with history, math, and science is also required before students start learning how to code. Sometimes an employer will require a degree before they look at programming skills, so this path is advantageous to those who need that piece of paper. There are programs in San Antonio teaching necessary programming skills that are less expensive and less time consuming than the traditional university route. Local tech giant Rackspace Hosting started Open Cloud Academy to give San Antonians a hands-on learning experience. Learning tracks include Linux Sys Admin and Network Operations. They have plans to add Software Development in the future. The courses are usually six to eight weeks long and cost around $4,000. Codeup is another great way to learn programming with a focus on Web Development. In twelve-weeks students go from non-techie to talented web programmer for between $9,875 to $13,900. Both programs offer special incentives for the ladies who want to learn how to code. There\u2019s a huge lack of diversity in the tech industry and they\u2019re looking to close the gap. Codeup offers 50% off tuition for several ladies each cohort and Open Cloud Academy gives out 20 scholarships for women participating in Linux for Ladies. Free less extensive classes are also available for teens and vets. Codeup Teens lets high school students get a taste of what being a programmer is all about, without having to pay a cent. The same opportunities are offered for veterans and active duty military through Codeup Vets. Younger kids can try out Made With Code for a basic and fun introduction to coding. Other single-day events include the very popular SA Code Jam for kids of all ages and the School\u2019s Out Hackathon run by actual high school students for high schoolers. San Antonio has a vibrant up-and-coming tech scene with lots of opportunities to get involved. Universities deliver a structured learning environment and degrees many employers are looking for. Bootcamps are perfect for those who want to learn quickly and start working.

One could probably use notepad and save their code to a floppy disk, but tools have evolved to be much more functional and a pleasure to use. The cool thing about programming is that there is always room to grow and improve; the same comes into play with learning new tools. Here are five tools every programmer should use when coding. Several of the editors that I stick close to are the Sublime Text, Textmate, and Vim. I tend to lean more towards Vim only because I have become used to its commands and the lack of mouse usage. Plus, you get bragging rights just about everywhere you go. Sometimes, I need to sift through list of data or do some front end work, so I tend to use Sublime Text. Textmate was my previous editor and is now open source, so I included it for your consideration. Another great tool when you are learning a new language or testing stuff out is a great REPL tool for that language. REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. You can run the languages\u2019 syntax through its provided REPL, giving you a better understanding of how the code works. Below is a list of REPLs I have used in the past: I listed the Chrome inspector for Javascript as a possible REPL program. Having a good browser helps when developing. Using Chrome\u2019s inspector for console.log has saved my life many times. It is a great way to debug and helps when you are trying to find your way through the flow. Using breakpoints help when following data flow throughout your code, as well. Chrome also has numerous extensions that allow users to customize their experience, and there are some great extensions made for developers. If you are interested in building your own extensions, Google offers some great documentation to make that work. Overall, Google Chrome has a lot to offer for developers working on the web. \u201cI love to run SQL statements and combine SQL statements on top of other SQL statements\u201d, said no one ever. Below is a list of nice to use GUI tools for database management: Last, but not least, I believe every programmer needs a rubber duck. Talking code out loud or explaining usually leads to the solutions you need for your code. Too often I would call or message a mentor of mine and talk to them about my code, and a solution would come to me in mid sentence. This gives my mentor the ability to ask \u201cDid you just rubber duck me?\u201d which is an awkward question in itself. Talking code out with a rubber duck before bothering a mentor will save you more than it will make you feel strange.

He came on our team because he is interested in entrepreneurship and our instruction methods and he believes that our environment is a great place to learn how to code. He wrote a guest blog to discuss why a recent grad should do Codeup: Codeup is a comprehensive programming bootcamp teaching non-programmers web development. Anybody who is interested in web development stands to learn and practice a great deal of skills during the course. Personally, I have recently completed my junior year at Arizona State University, where I am majoring in Computer Science. In the classroom, I have learned a lot about all the different types of sorts, running times, different software architectures, and so on. However, what I have not learned is how to effectively develop a web application. This is where the knowledge gained during college studies differs from the knowledge gained during the Codeup course. Codeup teaches people how to develop a web application and everything that this entails. Additionally, the teacher to student ratio at Codeup is vastly improved over the teacher to student ratio at many schools. Codeup has 2 or 3 instructors for 28 students, whereas in college courses where there is only 1 teacher and a few teacher assistants for a 70 plus person class. At Codeup, the focus is on the students instead of on the school football team, meaning that the curriculum is based on the performance of the students, and it is designed to push them further. The environment at Codeup is great in which to learn how to code. Additionally, the Codeup course teaches the students a variety of professional skills with the purpose of helping the students get hired after the course. The Codeup team is so confident in the course that they offer a job guarantee. If a student does not receive a good job offer within 6 months of completing the course, the course tuition will be refunded. The idea is that if students cannot succeed after the class, Codeup does not succeed, so they work hard to make certain students can find employment at great businesses. If you have graduated from college recently, with or without a CS degree but do not feel like you currently have a market-ready skillset, then Codeup is definitely something that you should take a look at. At the end of the course, you will be able to fully develop a web application. This, in combination with the variety of professional skills learned throughout the course, will make you an attractive employee to a wide variety of companies. Thank you, Rafa, for writing this blog. Want to take his advice? Apply now, be a developer in 6 months!"}, {"title": "How we Got Non-programmers to Fizzbuzz in Less Than a Week", "content": "We are about to begin our fourth week of Codeup, and the students are currently learning about HTML and how it works with PHP. In three full weeks, our students have learned more about programming in general than most people who start learning on their own. During the first week of instruction, we get our students right to coding. At the end of that week, we have them develop simple programs in command line. We begin our instruction with an introduction to the command line and the interactive shell. In a future blog post, we will discuss more about what type of environment our students are working with and how to set it up on your computer. For now, we are using Vagrant to boot into our virtual machine in order to make sure all the students are using the same version of PHP and other software. In the interactive shell, students are introduced to PHP and experiment with code there. From there, we teach students the fundamentals of programming, such as data types and control structures. In PHP, there are multiple data types, so at the beginning, we focus on scalar data types. Afterwards, we challenge our students with arrays and how they can hold other scalar data types along with other arrays. We also discuss variables, logical and comparison operators, and type juggling to give students a better understand of how variables and the data types variables store can be manipulated using PHP. All the while, we are giving students real world examples of how these fundamentals can be used. This is to keep in their mind that a strong understanding of the fundamentals will lead to a better programming experience. Along with variables and type juggling, we also introduce students to PHP functions, such as echo, var_dump, and print_r, to help them understand how debugging works and to see what their variables and data types look like as PHP is evaluating them. Toward the end of the week, we talk to our students about loops, such as while, do-while, and for loops. With this knowledge, the students are able to move through loops and have code working within the loops to have specific outputs. We spend some time each day lecturing, but the majority of the time, students are coding through assigned exercises. They have instructors and fellows moving about the classroom ready to help them if they have a question. We want to make sure students get as much personal attention as possible with our unprecedented teacher-student ratio. By the end of the week, the students have a strong understanding of how variables work, how math works in PHP, what control structures are and how to use them, what are the data types in PHP, and how to use loops. We challenge them to build FizzBuzz, which is a simple command line application that uses these fundamentals in a real way. FizzBuzz, for those of you who do not know, is a program that prints out a set of numbers, normally from 1 to 100. For every number that is divisible by 3, the computer prints the word \u201cFizz\u201d instead of the number. For every number that is divisible by 5, the computer prints out the word \u201cBuzz\u201d instead of the number. Lastly, for every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5, the computer prints out \u201cFizzbuzz.\u201d There are a number of ways to do it, but the knowledge of the fundamentals of programming is imperative. Interested in learning how to \u201cFizzBuzz,\u201d a common technical task in interviews? Become a developer with Codeup!

We\u2019re very happy to have him be a part of our class. He recently wrote a blog for us about why he wants to do Codeup: About two weeks ago, I had spent an afternoon planning my summer class schedule at Texas State University. This schedule had to be well-defined, ensuring I would have enough time to commute to San Marcos in the morning then drive back to San Antonio for my day job. It was a painstaking process, but I had finally cultivated the perfect schedule to fit my needs.\nHowever, the morning I learned about Codeup, I dropped all of the summer courses, scaled back the work hours, and enrolled immediately. Why? What is Codeup? Why am I deciding to stall my college education to take courses in a bootcamp about programming? At Texas State University, I spent that last three years working at the college radio station. Eventually, I was hired to become the production director in charge of managing a staff of over 30 volunteers and overseeing the production, implementation, and scheduling of all radio spots for airtime. When my term finished, I realized that deep-down in my heart that I loved working there because of the people, but I did not enjoy the work. Naturally, this terrified me. Here I am, roughly 30 credit hours away from a bachelor degree in a field I no longer have an interest in participating. I needed to get a job out of college. What else could a mass communication degree point me towards? It\u2019s no secret that the computer science industry is booming. We live in a time where we are witnessing ground-breaking innovation in technology on a daily basis. This has not only altered the world around us, but also how we interact with it and each other. Thirty years ago, maintaining a business was a primarily brick-and-mortar venture. If you had a dream to start selling clothes, you invest in a shop downtown and work harder to become popular in your city. Today, you can create the business from the luxury of your home and reach an exponential amount of customers. You can use tracking analytical tools to find out what items your customers are most interested in, then place advertisements to better tailor their interests. You can supply niche markets with products and be able to sustain yourself. You can even create your own start-up company to satisfy a new and upcoming demand. The craziest part about the industry is how accessible is it to break in to. Your educational background comes second to your experience and knowledge about development. Because of the rapidly evolving environment, traditional curriculum cannot keep up with the demand for web development related careers. At Texas State University, the most coding-oriented class offered was basic web design (when I return for the fall semester, a new class known as \u201cCoding and Data Skills\u201d will be available). Codeup is a full-time course that teaches you web development. Plain and simple. They are not an accredited institution with a traditional curriculum, and everything about them is revolutionary. (Editor\u2019s note: As an independent school,\u00a0Codeup\u00a0is licensed and\u00a0regulated\u00a0by the Texas Workforce Commission, approved by the Department of Veteran Affairs, and audited by the Council for Integrity in Results Reporting.) Although the class is made up of about 20-30 students, there are at least 3 instructors per cohort that are available to aid the students whenever they need it (a student ratio which absolutely stomps on my university\u2019s 300+ student-per-teacher ratios). They also provide consistent review sessions every day. If you have someplace to be during the weekdays, you can review with other students on Saturdays, all optional but available for any student that needs extra guidance. At first, I was extremely hesitant to take part in this unusual course structure. However, after my first week, I have become extremely motivated and even excited to finish and pursue a career in this field. For me, the most important factors are to feel the magic as I begin my programming journey and realize I could be doing this every day if done for a living. The instructors told us once that successful programmers code because they love it. I can say for me that it was love at first sight. We are looking forward to seeing how he grows as a developer and what he builds in the future! Good luck, Josue! Bio: Josue is a 21-year old senior at Texas State University. He was the production director for KTSW 89.9FM college radio station, producing hundreds of radio spots while directing a team of 20-30 volunteer staff. Under his leadership and production experience, the KTSW production department received three first-place awards: 2014 Winner for Best Radio Production (TIPA), 2014 Winner for Best Radio PSA (TIPA), and 2013 Winner for Best PSA for Cyber Security Awareness (South Central NBS). He has a strong passion for music in video games & film. In his free time, Josue produces for bands, singer-songwriters, and hip-hop artists.

I\u2019m working with enterprise level code using the .NET framework, MS SQL, and C#/Razor. I\u2019m using Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server for source control. I am honing my skills with some JavaScript libraries, such as Angular.js, moment.js, and jQuery. I am coding\u00a0in a completely different environment than what was taught at Codeup. The concepts and foundation that Codeup provided is allowing me to rapidly pick up the new environment with ease. I would like to work for a large company, such as Rackspace (applied), SACU, Whataburger, etc. This will be a tougher challenge as their requirements are a lot steeper than most smaller companies or startups. However,\u00a0I have applied to several smaller companies/startups with no response yet. Keep your head in the game. If you don\u2019t understand something or you are just getting by, grab an instructor, attend study hall, get to where you understand it.

There are plenty of tech jobs out there for people to get, but not everyone has the skills necessary to be successful in the tech industry.\u00a0Where are the best places to learn those skills? Programming bootcamps, of course! But before you click the apply button (right here), make sure that you fit these 7 signs you should do a programming bootcamp.\u00a0 You are bored at work; you stopped caring about meeting quotas ages ago; you are jealous of other people in different industries. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life doing something you dislike, working with people you hate, and earning a salary that grows slower than inflation? You need a career change, and a programming bootcamp can you get you into a career faster than going to a 4-year university or getting an expensive master degree. Computers fascinate you. You have always wondered how they work; you use them every day, and you are always wondering, \u201cHow did they make it work so well for me?\u201d You always know what apps to download and how to use productivity software. You need to understand how the technology works to start building new apps. Finding out about new things gets you excited. You love sharing your new knowledge with others, and you are excited when you can implement new knowledge into something. Learning how to program is a lifetime learning experience. You will more than likely learn new languages as time goes on and technologies improve. Once you understand the basics of programming, picking up a new language is simple. What is even better is that the learning that you do can directly translate to making more money. You see something wrong, and you have a strong inclination to fix it. There are things out there that make you mad, and you want to see them changed. You are the type of person who always says, \u201cYeah, but it can be done better\u201d then you need to be a programmer. You can solve real world problems and make life more efficient for thousands if not millions of people. All it takes is the skills to build a software solution to solve a problem and a problem that makes you angry. Get mad, get solving. You work long hours, and no one seems to care; You feel like people dismiss you because you are \u201clower level,\u201d and you want to be heard because you have ideas that can help others at work, but no one wants to give you a chance to speak. A lot of us have been there. As a developer, you are the one pulling the strings; you design the software, build it, and then implement it in the way you see fit. If something does not work out, you can fix it immediately because you understand coding and how computers work. People will value you for your skill set because not everyone knows how to build software. The community itself is always willing to listen to new ideas because we all depend on each other to build tools and help each other out move to the next level. Ideas are the same as mouths; Everyone has one, and they can be big or small, depending on who you are and how much you love to talk. The difference between people who have a great idea and the people to execute on their ideas is the gumption to execute. If you have ideas you think people will want to buy in to, then there is no reason why you could not start a company and begin to work for yourself. You can also work as a freelance developer charge a high hourly rate. Consulting? You can do that, too! All it takes is the skills you learn from a programming bootcamp. At the very least, you are the type of person who is happy when you see someone enjoy something you have built. Whether it is a bird feeder, a house, an event, a dress, or a nice dinner, you develop a great sense of pride when you see people use or enjoy something you have created. Being a programmer is the same thing; you can build software that people can use, and in many ways, it cane make their lives better.

I ended my \u201cformal\u201d schooling in Seguin just under 30 years ago, and I find it interesting that it took coming back to San Antonio to finally take control of my future. Majoring in accounting in a liberal arts university, I was exposed to programming via required classes in COBOL and BASIC. That was my last exposure to programming, but computers always stayed part of my professional life. I found that I enjoyed figuring out new software and developing a user-end expertise in whatever programs I was required to use. I began using my degree after graduation, moving up in the accounting world in smaller, privately held companies until taking a position with Texaco in 1990. Once there, it didn\u2019t take very long to move into the overseas marketing department. Shortly after that, I found myself in El Salvador, then Honduras, New York, and finally the Dominican Republic. After 8 years overseas, I was tired of the constant moves and wanted to expand beyond gas stations and convenience stores, so I was looking forward to new adventures and moving back to the States when Texaco was purchased. However, I was too long out of accounting to go back and too long out of the States to easily find something outside of my experience. Once again, I changed direction, finally ending up in the merchandising industry out of Houston where I spent most of the past 10 years. Although a booming industry, it is somewhat risky for management as contracts shift and change (or are canceled) on a regular basis. Three years ago, I was courted by my latest employer when one of the clients moved to them, and I became an Account Manager overseeing that client. A year ago, the company transferred me to San Antonio. And then the company declared it was financially ruined due to the nature of its core business \u2013 book and magazine distribution. It was purchased by another this past October, days before closing its doors. I was hired by the new company, but it also announced it was having financial difficulties. So, after many leaps into new industries, countries, cities, etc., I found myself once again looking for a path. This time, however, I wanted the leap to be logical and one in which I could find stability and fulfillment. Just days after knowing I had to change again, I heard someone from Codeup speaking on Texas Public Radio. I wrote down the name and started my research. Three months later, after looking into the industry, I quit my job and started a new life as a web developer by becoming a student at Codeup. I\u2019ve made so many leaps in my life but never before had I made a leap of logic. In the past, my leaps were made because someone else said I had to or should do something. This time, it\u2019s because it is the logical thing to do. I was terrified of the unknown each time I made a change, but as I sit in this classroom with only 3 more weeks to go to complete the Codeup course, I become more and more confident that this is exactly where I am supposed to be. The entire world is moving more towards computers and web applications, and I am right on top of that wave. Sharon was born in California but spent most of her childhood in Miami. She graduated from Texas\u00a0Lutheran University after majoring in accounting and then moved back to Miami. She was with the Latin American/West Africa/Caribbean group of Texaco for 12 years, 8 of those in international positions throughout Central America and the Caribbean. She returned to the States in 1990, leaving Texaco and landing in Houston.\u00a0She moved to San Antonio a year ago when the company she worked for offered her a promotion."}, {"title": "We Don\u2019t Play the Textbook Game", "content": "This kind of stuff makes us sad.

Well, a few more weeks have passed since then, and I think it would be appropriate now to discuss my reasons for attending the course in the first place. I have always been a creative person, and since I can remember I\u2019ve been looking for ways to express my creativity. I grew up reading tons of books, comics, and magazines. I also loved drawing, playing video games and solving puzzles. When I was a kid, my dad used to have a pile of these old Atari magazines, and each issue had these short coding programs, written in BASIC if I\u2019m not mistaken. If you typed in all the code correctly, a dinky little game would run. Nothing compared to X-Box or Playstation, but at the time, though, I thought it was pretty awesome! The past few years, personally and professionally, I\u2019ve gotten away from being the creative person I once was. So, I guess you could say that by joining the Codeup program, I\u2019ve come full circle. Except now, I am the one writing the code, not copying it from the back of Atari magazines, and the apps I\u2019ll eventually be able to create will put those old BASIC games to shame. Well enough about me, back to the class. We have moved away from working in the command line, which is what we did the majority of the first few weeks with PHP. \u00a0We are now working in the browser writing basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Putting together all we know, we have been able to create working apps and games. Pretty cool for someone who knew nothing about code a month ago! The things I\u2019ve created so far are pretty basic when compared to the advanced work of some of my fellow cohorts. It\u2019s like those cake memes you see on Facebook comparing baking expectations with reality. My code is more like the deformed blob of a Minion cake than something you would see on Cake Boss. Definitely not something you want to bring to a child\u2019s birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese unless you want to make them cry. I kid, but honestly the learning curve has remained steep, at least for me. I\u2019ve always been the kind of student who picked things up quickly, finished his work early, and then read ahead or did extra credit work while my peers struggled to catch up.\u00a0Now, I am one of the last ones to finish an exercise, and that is a bit humbling to say the least. At times there are moments of clarity, where the hazy fog over my brain slowly lifts, and I fully understand an exercise, and I have that \u201ca-ha!\u201d moment. Other times, not so much. The instructors are great, though, in reviewing each exercise and seeking to provide as much clarity as possible. However, since this is an accelerated web development course, we can only spend so much time on one subject before we have to move on to the next exercise. That being said, there is plenty of opportunity for study hall. Junior instructors will stay a few hours after class and even make themselves available on the weekends to help us or clarify problem areas. I strongly encourage future cohorts to take advantage of these times as much as possible, and ask plenty of questions. Also, keep writing code. Not just to understand the logic, but also to become accustomed to how code looks stylistically. There are certain conventions that must be followed regarding code format. One last thing to keep in mind, as difficult as it may seem at times, coding is just stringing together a bunch of simple functions, which eventually become an intricate framework of simple ideas. As such, simplicity and, even more important, readability is key. At some point in the future, someone else will have to read your code. If it is hard to follow or read, they are going to shake their fists in the air and curse your first-born child! Six months from now, YOU may be the one reading your old code. So, keep it simple. Remember to be kind to your future self! I sincerely hope to see some of you all in one of the upcoming classes this year! In the meantime, read all you can about web development, and Always Be Coding!

These blogs will be ranging from their experience in the program, why they are doing the program, and what they hope to do afterward. We want our students to express themselves and be heard, letting people know what it the program is like from a primary source and give people insight as to why someone would want to put themselves through a high stress, immersive programming bootcamp. Our first student blog is from Mario M.: When one thinks of boot camp, the first thing that comes to mind is shaved heads, tons of work packed into every second of the day, quick meals, and dark circles under the eyes from a lack of sleep. Now, I\u2019ve been through Marine Corps boot camp, and while there\u2019s been no shaving of heads here at Codeup (yet!), the rest has held true so far, at least for me. Just like actual boot camp, this has been no walk in the park. As a noob web developer, my first week at Codeup can only be equated to a non-swimmer being thrown into the deep end of the pool with no water wings or foam noodle to hold on to, who upon flailing and splashing his way to the edge of the pool discovers that his trunks have fallen off and sunk to the bottom of the pool. Talk about immersion! The lessons have come fast and furious, each building upon the other. I have to admit: I have fallen behind at times. Learning how to navigate a Mac at the same time as learning how to code has not been fun! \u201cHow do I switch applications?\u201d \u201cI created a file but now I can\u2019t find it!\u201d \u201cCommand L or Command TAB?\u201d \u201cThis is taking me forever to type everything out longhand! How is everyone finishing so damn quickly!!? Oh, you mean I can just hit the up arrow?\u201d \u201cWhat does full stack mean? This is not IHOP! I am hungry though! Pancakes sound good right about now??\u201d Note to self: keep your internal dialogue to yourself, Mario. Moving on to the coursework. So far, we\u2019ve been learning PHP and working with command lines. Even with the pre-work that we were assigned before class started, I was and still am at times completely lost. Thankfully, the instructors and TA\u2019s have a lot of patience in explaining the concepts. Little by little, the knowledge is beginning to sink in. Some days are better than others, but I can slowly see the progression. I think I am just a bit hard on myself, being a perfectionist and all. Normally, I am a quick learner, which is why I\u2019ve gotten even more frustrated with my lack of progression. As someone who is still unfamiliar with coding terminology, even asking a question can be a chore. I imagined hearing this quote from the movie \u201cI, Robot\u201d as an instructor\u2019s response to me trying to verbalize my question: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my responses are limited. You must ask the right questions.\u201d To expand on that in a more serious manner, the instructors won\u2019t just GIVE you the solution. They will lead you in the right direction, but you have to put in the work by reading the PHP manual, reviewing the previous modules, or using my friend Google. That being said, class time is devoted to reviewing the previous modules, which gives us all a chance to look over our work and discover any mistakes we made. The cohorts also try to help each other out when they can. As the class progresses, I hope that I am more capable to offer help than I am at this point. Looking at the big picture, I have learned a lot in a short amount of time. We all have. The instructors keep harping on the fact that we know more in one week than some web devs learned in their first year. Hard to imagine, yes, but it\u2019s not just something said to raise our spirits. Other seasoned web devs have said the same thing to us, as well. There seems to be quite a buzz around Codeup, which is very encouraging. We\u2019ve already had several guest speakers, among them city councilman Diego Bernal, and each of them seemed genuinely enthusiastic about Codeup. More people in the Geekdom community seem to want to get involved and see that we succeed. Everyone is very positive and excited, and the fact that this is taking place of San Antonio bodes well for the community going forward. So next up for us is HTML and CSS. I hope I pick it up quicker than I did PHP. I may not see the light at the end of the tunnel yet, but I know it will be rapidly approaching!

We also love hearing about people and organizations looking to bridge the gender gap in the tech industry. We were recently contacted by a woman who wanted to talk to us about her daughter, Laura W. Laura had participated in National Center for Women and Information Technology Aspirations in Computing Award. The purpose of the contest is to \u201cbuild a talent pool for the growing technical workforce and help academic and corporate organizations celebrate diversity in computing by honoring young women at the high-school level for their computing-related achievements and interests.\u201d Laura was a runner-up for the competition, which is quite impressive seeing how there were 350 applicants from around the country. She was introduced to the competition via the Girls Who Code program, which is an eight week summer program where she learned how to code in languages, such as Scratch, JavaScript, C, Python, JQuery Mobile, and HTML/CSS. Girls Who Code works to bridge the gender gap in technology through immersive summer programs that introduce young women to computer programming. \u201cDuring the eight weeks, I learned something that I had never even heard about: coding,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cAfter being introduced to coding, I feel like it is a part of my life and is something that is really important to me and should be even more important to other young women.\u201d Women make up roughly 12% of the hires in the tech industry, according to Lauren Bacon, cofounder of Raised Eyebrow Web Studio. When asked about the problem of the lack of women in the industry, Laura states that she thinks there are not many women in programming because \u201cthey feel they are intimidated by boys.\u201d There is truth in what she says; the tech industry has been a boys\u2019 club for a while. We\u2019d like to see that change. We\u2019re very proud to see more young women finding their passion in computer technology, and we\u2019d like to see Laura be successful in the industry in the future!

Full stack die-hards would consider a full stack developer to have specialized knowledge in all stages of software development. Thus, they would be proficient, if not fluent, in: Is this possible in Web 2.0? Naysayers argue that with the increasingly diverse aspects of web development, it\u2019s virtually impossible to be a true full stack developer. Frankly, it may not even be practical to do so. Others are of the opinion that a full stack developer is simply someone who is familiar with all layers in computer software development. These developers aren\u2019t experts at everything; they simply have a functional knowledge and ability to take a concept and turn it into a finished product. Such gurus make building software much easier as they understand how everything works from top to bottom and can anticipate problems accordingly. In our opinion, this is the most realistic definition of a full stack developer. Often times, \u00a0this class of developers stems from start-up environments, where a vast knowledge of all facets of web development is essential for a business\u2019 survival. Clearly, it takes years of work experience in different languages, roles, and industries to reach this level of\u00a0qualification. Because of this, full stack developers are few and far between, making those who exist very employable and in-demand. Interested in becoming a full stack developer?

This field is very exciting!\u201d In my head, I asked myself, \u201cWhy does one have to be young to want to learn something new?\u201d It is never too late to start a new career or learn a new skill that will be very useful in the coming years. The opthamologist makes a lot of good money and has worked hard for many years to get to where he is now. He has earned his place in society without a doubt. However, it goes to show that people, no matter where they are in life or society, yearn to learn something new and exciting. Why not learn something that could potentially benefit you in the near future? If you can see the potential in learning computer programming and understanding technology at a deeper level, then you owe it to yourself to learn. There are many free resources online allowing you to learn and coding bootcamps that can teach you programming at a deeper level in a very short time.

It is the skill of today and the future."}, {"title": "Front-end vs Back-end", "content": "We can differentiate between front-end and back-end development easily by understanding that web designers focus on the design, typography, colors, etc. (front-end development), while web programmers focus on back-end development using specific languages (MySQL, PHP, other database languages, etc). Front-end = what you see; back-end = how it works. These days, front-end development refers to the part of the web users interact with. In the past, web development consisted of people who worked with Photoshop and those who could code HTML and CSS. Now, developers need a handle of programs like Photoshop and coding in not only in HTML and CSS, but also JavaScript or jQuery (a compiled library of JavaScript). Websites combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all controlled by the browser. For example, if you use Google Chrome or Firefox, the browser translates all of the code in a manner for you to see and interact with, such as fonts, colors, drop-down menus, sliders, forms, etc. In order for all of this to work, though, something has to support the front-end; here the backend comes into play. In a previous blog, we talked about how web programmers are concerned with launching websites, updates, and maintenance, among other things. All of that works to support the front-end of the website. The back-end has three parts to it: server, application, and database. To better explain, let\u2019s use the example of a customer trying to purchase a plane ticket using a website. Everything that the customer sees on the webpage is the front-end. However, once the customer enters all of their information (ie. their name, billing address, destination, etc), the web application stores the information in a database that was created previously on the server where the website is calling for information. The web application creates, deletes, changes, renames, etc items in the database. For example, when a customer purchases a ticket, that creates an item in the database, but when they change their order or they wish to cancel, they change the item in the database. A server, in the simplest form, is a computer accessed remotely that runs software to fulfill requests from clients. In our example, the server the customer\u2019s browser is communicating with is where the database is stored and modified. When a customer wants to buy a ticket, the backend operation web application communicates with the server to make a change in a database stored on said server. Backend programmers use technologies like Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, and others to make this communication work smoothly, allowing the customer to purchase his or her ticket with ease. Many of these technologies relate to eachother. They all work together to make something work. Some developers can program for both front-end and back-end. However, it takes much more time to design while programming the back-end. It all depends on the project and what technologies and skills are needed where. Which do you prefer? Does front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interest you more? Or do you see yourself as a back-end champion tackling technologies like PHP, Python, and Ruby? Whichever your choice, you can learn how to use these programming languages in Codeup. Our classes focus on Java and client-side JavaScript; This leaves room for our graduates to decide whether they would like to pursue front-end or back-end development.

They often work closely with web designers who are mostly responsible for making websites look aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, depending on the audience. Simply put, web programmers are responsible for how the website works. Websites are not things that people can build and just leave on the Internet and expect great results. As things change over time, such as company growth and diversification of products and services, websites need to be maintenanced and updated. In order to do so, programmers must know a variety of programming languages, such as C++, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, HTML, and CSS, in order to build websites more completely and build apps within the websites. Launching websites When web apps are built for different platforms, it is up to web programmers to make sure that the launch of the application goes smoothly. An example of a website launch gone awry at launch time would be healthcare.gov. When the site was launched last year, the site did not work as it had been advertised for many people, becoming an embarrassment for the federal government. The website was rushed in order to meet a specific deadline. Launching websites takes a lot of time and a team of people to make sure that the website meets all of the criteria set form by the team or company and works properly as a version 1.0. Websites can always be updated later, but the first version of the website has to be stable and working for as many users as possible, unless companies are interested in having another failure like the health care website. Updates Web programmers are responsible for updating websites with new apps and features in order to keep up with changes in the business landscape. Web programmers have to query users to gain insight on additional application requirements for web apps. This way, they can figure out what specifications they need in order to build apps that will work with what software and hardware people are using. For example, recently, Google had made it a requirement if people wanted a YouTube account, it would be directly connected to Google+. This was a huge change to the website and the way people login and manage their channels on YouTube, and there were problems, but in the end, it has been working and updated with bug fixes to keep it running smoothly, which is another responsibility for web programmers. Maintenance Imagine if high-traffic websites, like Facebook, Google, and YouTube, were not kept up and never updated. They would fail immensely and never amount to anything. People would leave and go someplace else that is properly maintained. Web programmers need to maintain websites to make sure they are functioning well. Coding is very difficult, and ideas on paper may not work in the real world, so programmers have to go back into the code, debug it, test it, and continue this process until they are able to make stable changes to websites. This is also why when you see major updates for websites, they are few and far between. Smaller updates take less time and are meant for maintenance. Salary Web programmers can make between $40,000 \u2013 $80,000 per year, depending on experience and level of work. Some can make much more than that, depending on who they work for and what they are doing. Salaries are expected to go up in the future, so learning how to code now and programming websites are good strategies to start a new life in a new career. Now that we talked about web designers and web programmers, we can talk about the different jobs of web programmers, differentiated in two categories: front-end and back-end.

Contact us here or give us a call at (210) 802-7289."}, {"title": "What is a Web Designer?", "content": "The big world of computer programming contains many roles that need to cooperate for everything to work. Think of \u201ccomputer programming\u201d as an umbrella term for many different types of people doing different but complementary things. Today, we will discuss the meaning of a web designer, a term used in the computer programming field. We will be begin with what we see when we look at a web page: the design. A web designer handles the way a web page looks. When users access a web page, the ease with which they find necessary information determines the quality of the user experience. If the website looks ugly or feels difficult to navigate, users probably won\u2019t return to the website. Some examples of the technologies web designers will use include HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Flash, and JavaScript. This list outlines things that web designers have to keep in mind when deciding how to design a website: Marketing and communication How can we define the target group and what works with them? A web designer must consider these questions, among others, when thinking about the design of the website. For example, if we consider culture as a factor for a target group, look at the Korean website G-Market and the American website Amazon. Many websites in the Asian market contain cluttered graphics that constantly try to get your attention. However, in the North American market, Amazon treats its customers differently. They only offer what consumers find interesting based on their browsing history. Designers must understand their audience and how best to communicate with them before diving into the design of the website. User experience\u00a0 Without appropriate labeling and an understanding of how the website works, a user cannot gain any useful information from a website. Depending on a user\u2019s level of computer literacy, having a difficult user experience will prevent that user from using the website ever again. Great user experience allows users to gain the most from a website at any given time. In terms of user interactivity, the complexity depends on what needs to be relayed to the user. For example, if the website gives users directions to a specific location, then an interactive map would help to have. However, if the website has a more complicated purpose, then the interactivity becomes an even larger issue that must be address in design. Overall, user experience and interactivity should encourage users to continue coming back to the website. Layout Layout basically means the skeleton of the page, and deals with things like pixel width, alignment, grids, and others. Should all of the pages in the website have the same basic layout, or should it all be different? Aesthetically, we can appreciate it more easily if it is all consistent, but sometimes page layout has to be changed. Consider layout as the foundation and frame of the website design; everything else gets built within its parameters. Typography Serif? Sans serif? The types of typefaces and type styles strongly influence the way a website looks and how users interpret it. We should also note that you never want to use Comics Sans. Never, ever use Comic Sans. Graphics Graphics are pictures that are on the website. The designer has to decide where it is best to put them if there is also text. However, if graphics are the highlighted feature of any said website, then they have to have precedence over text. Look at Pinterest and compare it to Facebook. Photos take precedence on Pinterest whereas with Facebook, it has much less precedence. Salary Now, for the big question: how much do web designers make? According to Salary.com, web designers make between $45,000 to $83,000 a year. Do you think you\u2019d like to do this job,, but don\u2019t have the skills necessary to do it? Apply at for Codeup, and we will get you started.

One thing became very clear: colleges are doing a terrible job producing programmers. Here\u2019s what we found out: Programming isn\u2019t fun \u00a0 Undergrad computer science has changed little since the late 1990s when I was in school. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed is the high weed-out rate of students in CS. According to a study out of the Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, between 30 and 50% of CS majors drop out and switch to other majors during their first intro to CS course. The number one reason: lack of motivation. Colleges don\u2019t make CS fun, and that\u2019s a tragedy. College takes a long time Many people went back to school hoping to become developers. \u00a0In the case of an associate\u2019s program, it take 2 years or more. A classic college education is four years. You do not want to know about how much it costs (click here to find out). College includes things that aren\u2019t necessary to do a programming job Does one really need a full liberal arts degree with electives to be employable? As the recent crops of college graduates have demonstrated, a college degree doesn\u2019t mean a future. Lectures are a terrible way to learn coding Think of programming like learning a new spoken language. Is that best done sitting in classroom or being on the streets of a foreign country talking with the locals? The same thing goes for college where the lecture format still dominates. Colleges teach what they can sell Colleges sell degrees, not futures. \u00a0If a college had to guarantee a future to its graduates, would they offer so many degrees that produce people with no useful skills? Professors (often) teach what interests them For those of us who took a class from a research professor, we discovered quickly that our semester long class would be 20% quickly going through course materials and an 80% deep dive on the professor\u2019s personal research interests. It\u2019s great that the professor thinks that pandas are a majestic animal, but the class is Biology, not endangered species 101. College is slow to keep up In tech, things move incredibly fast. Here\u2019s the problem with college development: departments start planning their offerings several years before the student is taught the information. By that time, it\u2019s likely the real world has changed so much that the student is being taught information from 3 or 4 years ago. In visiting some CS departments, I have heard from students that their professors were teaching languages that went out of real-world usage decades ago. So, STEM education is broken. Schools need to align their interests with those of the students. Schools need to make tech accessible. Schools need to put students first, rather than treat them as customers. Students should finish with a future and not a mountain of debt. And so on. Things need to change. We think there\u2019s a better answer, and we\u2019ve designed it. If schools sold you an education but not a future, we have the answer.

Three reasons: 1) They have a skill with limited supply of people that can do it, 2) the difference between a mediocre and good lawyer is really apparent, and 3) they work on really important stuff (i.e., when people hire a lawyer, the job needs to be done right). Sound familiar? This why programmers get paid so well, too. 1) Limited supply of people Even in our very own San Antonio, TX, there just are not enough programmers to meet the demand that employers have. They often have to look elsewhere in order to find people to fulfill their technology needs. A lot of programmers who are also homegrown here in San Antonio leave the city in order to find jobs elsewhere because they are not aware of all of the opportunity that lies here. \u00a0The United States is even giving foreign people with computer science backgrounds work visas to live in the US and offer their skills. Looking for a career in which you will always be needed? This is it. 2) The difference between good and bad are apparent Any lawyer that tells you that a case is \u201ca slam dunk\u201d is a bad lawyer. Any lawyer that stumbles and fumbles through the law as if he or she were riding a unicycle on a rocky road is an awful lawyer. Any programmer that builds apps full of bugs and that crash every time you open them and calls it a finished product is a bad programmer. It is easy to tell the difference between something that is good and something that is awful, especially with computer programming. You know something is good when the program is doing what it is meant to do without issues. It\u00a0feels flawless, which means a lot of hard work went into building it. However, like the examples above, bad lawyers and programming are quite apparent. Would you use Facebook as much if it worked like MySpace when MySpace was popular? Chances are you would not. 3) They work on important things Look at your smartphone or tablet and think about all of the apps you use on a daily basis. Then, look at your laptop or desktop computer and think about all of the things you use those for. Now, look at your job and all of the software and technology necessary to keep you afloat, aware, and productive. Chances are that you rely heavily on technology on a day-to-day basis, and a lot of it is important for our lives, personally and professionally. Computer programmers, among others, are the people behind a lot of the things we take for granted every day. They work on important things, and they need to be paid well for it. You would not want to pay as little as possible for an architect to design your family\u2019s home; why would you want a computer programmer to be paid very little to make your life much more frustrating with buggy and incomplete software? These are just three simple reasons why computer programmers, like lawyers, get paid a lot of money. It\u2019s really about what they do and who they do it for. Right now is the best time to learn how to become a computer programmer and start getting paid well for doing important things. If you\u2019d like to learn more about how you can get the most out this profession, apply for Codeup and let\u2019s talk!"}, {"title": "The College Financing Scam and How We\u2019re Doing Things Differently", "content": "Here\u2019s the dirty secret of private college \u201cfinancing\u201d and how it really works. Private colleges first set a ridiculously high list price. Here\u2019s my alma mater\u00a0Lafayette College as an example. Their all-in cost per year now is $57,000 (food not included, sorry). Here\u2019s the secret: most everyone doesn\u2019t pay nearly that much. They get \u201cfinancial aid.\u201d The financial aid office studies each family\u2019s finances, tax returns, and background and then uses a formula to determine financial aid and grants. In other words, they look to see the maximum that a family can afford and charge that amount. To repeat: colleges study how much you can possibly afford and then set the price for you. This is like a car dealer looking at your tax return and deciding how much you should pay for a car. That\u2019s wrong. Of course, the department that looks at financial aid is a cost center for the school. Colleges have to hire financial aid assistants, governmental compliance managers, debt collectors, managers to manage the managers, and so on. Therefore, tuition has to be higher to pay for more staff to handle the amount of loans, aid, and financing that must be arranged. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. For most\u00a0colleges, the price that you pay is not only for the cost of your classes. You pay for everything else that the college has to offer, even if you do not use all of their services, such as their sports teams, gyms, luxury dormitories, etc. The rising cost of college is also affected by administrators with\u00a0bloated salaries\u00a0and\u00a0inefficient spending, but not teacher salaries.\u00a0For example, 42 college presidents\u00a0made over $1\u00a0million in compensation in 2012. Additionally, many universities are having to spend millions on trying to attract more students to apply because they have to compete for students on a\u00a0global scale. The result of this process is that the parents and students are forced to take out student loans that will take decades to pay off. We know tons of people who are saddled with student debt in their late 30s and early 40s. Young people graduate with tons of debt and no guarantee of a future. Is that the way education should work? We think that\u2019s garbage. People ask if they can use government grants, conventional student loans, GI Bills, and other public or private financing sources. We say no because we don\u2019t want to punish our students because the higher education system is fundamentally broken. If we join other educational institutions exploiting students and government funding, we\u2019ll slowly become the bureaucratic mess they have become. Instead, we want to spend our time working to prepare our students. We think that higher-education needs a complete rethinking. Education should be tied to a future, not to a slip of paper. If an educational program wins while students lose, that is a failed institution and system. With Codeup, you get what you pay for. We put our money where our mouth is. We do not ask for government handouts. We do not saddle students with any debt until we get them a future. You win, we win. You lose, we lose. Students first, always, and that is how it should be."}, {"title": "Why Isn\u2019t the San Antonio Tech Scene Growing Faster?", "content": "The simple answer is computer programming talent. These are the people that can take a business\u2019 or customer\u2019s requirements and create software products that solve their problems. \u00a0These people are at the apex of the tech ecosystem. \u00a0They don\u2019t just maintain or configure, they imagine, design and create new things for technology to do. The symptoms are everywhere: \u2022 Established tech companies cannot hire. Rackspace has taken the significant step of creating the Open Cloud Academy to train people who can work entry-level Linux administration jobs. Sweb Development and Denim Group both opened satellite offices in other cities to recruit talent. \u00a0Rackspace opened a second\u00a0Geekdom\u00a0in San Francisco to get access to talent there. \u00a0Big tech companies are opening branch development offices in Austin or Chicago rather than here. \u2022 Startups cannot hire. One local startup recently hired a developer who had never worked in their chosen programming language. The choice of hiring a smart person to spend months learning a new skill or having no hire at all is an awful choice to make, but it is something we see all too often. \u2022 Entrepreneurs are not able to find their founding team. I run the\u00a0San Antonio Tech Co-Founders Wanted meetup. We usually get about 20 people. At most, 1-2 are programmers. The rest are business and design people. \u2022 Graduates are leaving. I have spoken at the Computer Science departments at UTSA, Trinity, and St. Mary\u2019s University this year. Many of the students I spoke with were planning to leave the city. Our brightest high school graduates are leaving, too. The officers of the computer society at UT Austin are most all San Antonio kids. We think the answer is making more of our residents programmers. More programmers means more people starting companies and those startups hiring more people. People who create companies that create more jobs for San Antonio are the ones we want to bring up and support. \u00a0(Don\u2019t believe that a few tech startups can change a city for the better? \u00a0Just look at what the Rackspace founders have changed since they start 15 years ago.) My startup,\u00a0Codeup, is part of the solution as are things like\u00a0Open Cloud Academy\u00a0from Rackspace and\u00a0CodeHS\u00a0at Highlands High School. However, there is more to be done. CodeHS is only in one school. Codeup\u2019s first cohort will be less than 30 students. We are a drop in the bucket of what can be done to make high-tech, and the great careers it provides, as big of a component of the San Antonio economy as tourism and medicine. To get more programmers out there, we need to make their creation a focus at all levels of education. Programming competitions should be treated with the same celebration as multi-million dollar high school football programs. We should have magnet schools for programming like we do for health careers. We need to make high-tech in San Antonio from kindergarten through college our top priority. It\u2019s possible. \u00a0Let\u2019s get more programmers out there building a brilliant future for San Antonio."}, {"title": "Why People Can\u2019t Learn Programming on Their Own", "content": "While developing Codeup, we interviewed dozens of people who attempted to\u00a0learn programming\u00a0on their own. We wanted to delve into their experience to uncover lessons learned. \u00a0We discovered the self-taught method was done with good intentions but the result was unfortunately failure. Here are some of the reasons it didn\u2019t work out. 1. \u00a0Beginning point Our interviewees really didn\u2019t know where to start. The topic of technology is huge, so determining a beginning point was difficult. Most people don\u2019t know what to learn first. One person told us she started with Java, a popular programming language. Although it\u2019s widely used, it\u2019s difficult to learn. I know because I wrote four books on it. 2.\u00a0\u00a0Online resources suck Computers and online lessons stink at teaching anything complex. If you can\u2019t understand a topic, your only option for clarification is to have the online resource explain it to you again the exact same way. That doesn\u2019t work at advancing your knowledge. What is beneficial to your learning is having a live instructor understand your thought process so that he/she can customize the instruction for you. In programming, concepts build on one another. For each concept you learn, the preceding topic must be understood. If you\u2019re missing a core concept, you won\u2019t understand the next one. 3. \u00a0Lack of focus Computer programming is intense. We discovered that people lose their focus because the topic is not easily absorbed. It takes time to learn and practice programming, a big investment that some are not willing to make long-term. Some think they can learn it within a weekend or at night, but that approach only sets them up for failure. Another reason people lose their focus is because life gets in the way. 4. \u00a0Single minded One is a lonely number when you\u2019re learning on your own. Lessons learned in solitude are not beneficial because there is only one perspective \u2014 yours. \u00a0People get more out of instruction when they learn in groups \u2013 the one thing the current education system gets right. \u00a0Peers within groups motivate others to perform better. \u00a0Having individuals as part of a group instantly creates a community where everyone is traveling the same journey. 5. \u00a0Reasons to learn For most people, learning programming had no clear endpoint. They had difficulty envisioning life after the lesson. Do I really get a job? Am I building something meaningful? Having invested a lot of time and energy on programming, people started to question \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d The Codeup model addresses these issues in a learning system we\u2019ve developed into a single, intense 9-week boot camp with live instructors. Students finish with a Hiring Day where they demonstrate a live, production-ready application to show prospective employers. We\u00a0want to teach you about programming, so you can put this skill to work to improve your life and those of others. Are you ready to step into the future?"}, {"title": "What is Our Noble Cause?", "content": "In his\u00a0TEDx San Antonio\u00a0presentation this fall, Nick Longo, co-founder of\u00a0Geekdom, talked about finding one\u2019s\u00a0noble cause\u00a0as a means of fulfilling an entrepreneurial spirit. I related to this topic because I love to come up with ideas and find ways to solve problems. \u201cIdeation\u201d is my top strength, according to\u00a0Strengthsfinder. As I reflected on my noble cause, I looked back over the past several months, and it became clear to me that I was only addressing small problems, and I wasn\u2019t considering the larger problems at my doorstep. I accepted certain norms that were problematic as unsolvable, defaulting to solving niche problems. I could have made money solving these niche problems, but that would be a small change on a big scale. I\u2019d be putting out the embers rather than the raging flames in my community. My noble cause then became solving bigger problems to make a big impact, not just make money. The big issue In my circles, I often engage in the discussion of hiring developers. \u201cI just can\u2019t find any good ones,\u201d I would hear from business leaders. \u201cI am right out of college, but I cannot build a website for the life of me,\u201d university graduates would say. I would hear things like this from companies I have mentored at Geekdom,\u00a0where we office, from friends running companies large and small, and from students looking for work. \u00a0The blaring issue that reared its ugly head was \u201cWhy does everyone have trouble hiring developers?\u201d Most business owners and managers accept this as a fact of life; I decided to make this my noble cause and make a big impact. Getting busy with it When one finds that noble cause, it becomes one\u2019s mission in life to see it come to fruition. As\u00a0Nick Longo\u00a0said, \u201cBusiness is the mindset; entrepreneurship is the heartset.\u201d The\u00a0Codeup team\u00a0stepped out of its comfort zone and went on a quest to provide some value to society. We took on the challenge of training new developers, giving people a meaningful second career, and we\u2019re helping companies find great people to do awesome work. Our team, Jason, Chris, Samantha, and myself, are ready to make our corner of the world better by solving this big problem in our town, San Antonio, Texas, and in our country, one person at a time. Our mission continues beyond the classroom too. We\u2019ve partnered with reputable companies who desire knowledgeable programmers to hire. We welcome other businesses in the San Antonio community who want to find great programmers who are anxious to get to work. Do you want to join us in this mission? Do you want to make a difference? \u00a0We\u2019ll teach you how."}, {"title": "Scholarships for Women: Why We\u2019re Doing It", "content": "A hot topic that is trending is the special treatment ladies in the tech industry receive just because their women. No one can deny there\u2019s too few women in this field. According to a National Public Radio report, about 20 percent of all U.S. computer programmers are female. So, in order to draw the ladies in, companies within the technology industry give them incentives to engage. One way we do that is by offering a ladies only tuition scholarship. We want to them to populate the computer programming field for many reasons:"}, {"title": "Student Profile: Leslie Tolbert", "content": "Leslie Tolbert, Texas State graduate and communication design major, has been trying to learn to program on her own for some time now. \u00a0She said: \u201cIt can be difficult to keep a steady flow of motivation when you are learning how to program on your own, no matter how driven you are to reach your goals.\u201d Leslie learned of our program through word of mouth around the Geekdom community. She explained that she had dabbled in computer programming some but like most other students failed to find the proper instruction needed to be proficient in the technologies. \u201cApplying for and being accepted as a Codeup student meant making a full commitment to my goals in becoming an excellent programmer and making an investment in myself to do so in a challenging, rewarding 9-week time span.\u201d Our program requires a full-time commitment during these 9-weeks but all for the reason that we want to make sure you get your money\u2019s worth. Leslie admitted that she was most excited about being in a collaborative environment with hands-on learning and instruction from the experienced teachers and motivated peers. \u201cBringing people together from different backgrounds to learn and explore the possibilities of programming is much more stimulating than most traditional education approaches.\u201d After completing the class, Leslie hopes to enter the male-dominated programming field with confidence. Short term, Leslie plans to apply her knowledge to create the high quality products that positively impact us on a daily basis. Looking even further down the road she confesses, \u201cI want to inspire others to join the tech community and build awesome things with me!\u201d We\u2019re lucky to have her on board!"}]
